              "In LaTeX, you can use the `\\cite` command to create in-text citations and then display the full reference in your bibliography using BibTeX or another bibliography management system. Here's an example:\n\n1. First, ensure you have a bibliography file (with a `.bib` extension) containing your references. Let's assume your bibliography file is named `references.bib`.\n\n2. Use the `\\cite{}` command in your LaTeX document to create in-text citations. Inside the curly braces, put the citation key corresponding to the reference in your `.bib` file.\n\nHere's a minimal example:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\nAccording to \\cite{AuthorYear}, the research showed...\n\n% Your content goes here\n\n\\bibliographystyle{plain} % Specify the bibliography style\n\\bibliography{references} % Replace 'references' with your .bib file name\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\nReplace `AuthorYear` with the citation key you have in your `.bib` file.\n\nAfter compiling your LaTeX document using `pdflatex`, `bibtex`, and then `pdflatex` twice more, LaTeX will generate the in-text citation and a bibliography section containing the full reference based on the information provided in the `.bib` file.\n\nRemember, the specific commands and the bibliography style (`\\bibliographystyle`) might vary depending on your requirements or the style guide you're following (e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago). Adjust them accordingly."

This will include the full bibliography entry for that citation in a section titled \"Full Bibliography Entry\" within your document.\n\nRemember to replace `references` with the name of your `.bib` file, and adjust the citation keys and styles according to your bibliography file and preferred citation style."

              "The error message \"Undefined control sequence \\bibitem{}\" typically arises if you're using the `\\bibitem{}` command without having a bibliography environment set up, or if there's an issue with how the bibliography is being handled in your LaTeX document.\n\nTo create a bibliography in LaTeX, you should use BibTeX or BibLaTeX along with a specific bibliography style. Here's an example of how you might set it up:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\n\\usepackage{natbib} % or \\usepackage[style=authoryear]{biblatex}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\nAccording to \\citet{AuthorYear}, the research showed...\n\n% Your content goes here\n\n\\bibliographystyle{plainnat} % Specify the bibliography style (plainnat is an example, choose as needed)\n\\bibliography{references} % Replace 'references' with your .bib file name\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\nRemember to replace `AuthorYear` with the citation key for one of your references and `references` with the name of your bibliography file (`.bib`).\n\nEnsure that you've included the appropriate `\\usepackage{}` line for your bibliography package (`natbib` or `biblatex`) in your preamble. Also, compile your document using a sequence such as `pdflatex`, `bibtex`, `pdflatex`, `pdflatex` to properly generate the bibliography.\n\nIf you're using the `\\bibitem{}` command directly, make sure you have an appropriate `\\begin{thebibliography}{}` environment set up in your document, where you manually list your references. Here's an example:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\nAccording to \\cite{AuthorYear}, the research showed...\n\n% Your content goes here\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{9} % Replace '9' with the widest label number in your bibliography\n\n\\bibitem{AuthorYear} Author, A., \\& Year, Y. (Year). Title of the paper. Journal Name, Volume(Issue), Page range.\n\n% Add more \\bibitem{} entries for other references\n\n\\end{thebibliography}\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\nReplace `AuthorYear` with a label for your reference and provide the bibliography entries within the `thebibliography` environment. Adjust the widest label number (`9` in the example) to match the number of references you have.\n\nRemember to compile your document properly according to the method you choose for handling the bibliography."

Ensure that you have a BibLaTeX-compatible bibliography file (`.bib`) and the necessary `\\addbibresource{}` command pointing to it.\n\nWhen you compile your document, the `\\fullcite{}` command will output the entire bibliography entry for the specified citation key at the point where you've used it in the text.

              "In the 1990s, the Message Passing Interface (MPI) Standard emerged as a pivotal development to standardize the Application Programming Interface (API) for distributed memory computing. Over time, MPI has achieved widespread adoption, establishing itself as the de facto standard for distributed memory computing.\n\nThe evolution of the MPI Standard transpired through MPI 2 in 1997, MPI 3 in 2012, and the most recent version in 2021, with ongoing efforts by the MPI forum to formulate the subsequent iteration of the standard.\n\nBeyond the evolution of the MPI Standard, the contemporary (Network-)Hardware of modern systems has facilitated the emergence of novel paradigms such as Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA). This hardware advancement is mirrored in the newer iterations of MPI.\n\nHowever, despite these advancements, many applications continue to utilize a relatively constrained feature set from the MPI standard. A significant portion of applications restrict themselves to functionalities already present in the initial version of the MPI standard. For a comprehensive examination of prevailing MPI usage patterns, refer to Chapter XY.\n\nRegrettably, newer MPI features, including one-sided, persistent, or partitioned communication, have not yet garnered widespread adoption.\n\nPresent challenges in adopting Modern MPI encompass several facets:\n1. **Limited Knowledge of New Features by MPI Programmers:**\n   - Many MPI programmers are not well-versed in the features introduced in recent MPI versions, contributing to their underutilization.\n\n2. **Difficulty in Crafting Correct MPI Codes:**\n   - The MPI API's inherent complexity poses challenges in crafting error-free MPI codes, necessitating meticulous attention to detail.\n\n3. **Demonstrated Performance Benefits in Academia, Lagging Implementation in Main MPI Codebases:**\n   - While academia has demonstrated the performance advantages of new MPI features, their integration into mainstream MPI implementations is yet to be realized.\n\n4. **Pervasive Use of Older MPI Versions:**\n   - Prevailing inertia exists in adopting newer MPI features, as the majority of MPI implementations continue to rely on older versions. This stagnation results in a lack of incentive for MPI implementors to undertake the engineering efforts required to fully exploit the performance benefits offered by modern MPI operations."

              "To clarify the footnote and avoid confusion about the meaning of \"more relevant figures,\" you can rephrase the sentence as follows:\n\n\"When considering the assertion that no wildcards are used in \\cref{sec:assertions}, it is important to note that wildcard usage is quite limited: only $\\approx3\\%$ of point-to-point operations use \\texttt{MPI\\_ANY\\_SOURCE} and only $\\approx1\\%$ use \\texttt{MPI\\_ANY\\_TAG}. This indicates that the assertions explained in \\cref{sec:assertions} will apply to many applications. The complete results of our study, including additional relevant figures, are presented in \\cref{sec:paper:mpi-usage}.\"\n\nBy using \"additional relevant figures,\" the phrase clearly conveys that the figures presented in the referenced section are both numerous and pertinent, eliminating the need for the footnote explanation."

              "\\chapter{Introduction}\n\nIn the 1990s, the \\ac{MPI} Standard emerged to standardize the \\ac{API} for distributed memory computing.\nOver time, \\ac{MPI} has achieved widespread adoption, establishing itself as the de facto standard for distributed memory computing.\nSince then the (Network-)Hardware of modern Systems evolved considerately.\nModern systems allow for new paradigms like Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA).\nTODO citation, More exhaustive list of improvements?\n\nAlongside the development on the hardware side, the \\ac{MPI} standard evolved, to reflect those changes.\nAfter the first standard in 1994 \\cite{mpi10}, Several new features like \\ac{MPI} I/O or one-sided communication where added in version 2 of \\ac{MPI} in 1997 \\cite{mpi20}.\n\\ac{MPI} 3 was released in 2012 and contains several important additions to the MPI standard (e.g. non-blocking collective operations, new one-sided communication operations) \\cite{mpi30}.\nThe most recent major version 4 was published in 2021, introducing persistent collectives and partitioned communications among other important improvements \\cite{mpi4}.\nThe \\ac{MPI} forum continues working on the next version of the standard discussing the next set of improvements like a standardized application binary interface and more support for accelerators. \\cite{mpi50,mpi42}\n\nBut to this day, many applications use a quite limited featureset from the \\ac{MPI} standard.\nMost applications surprisingly only use functionality that was already included in version 1 or 2 of \\ac{MPI} standard, which was developed in the last century. \nThis work explores the \\ac{MPI} usage patterns more in depth in \\cref{sec:mpi-usage}.\n\nUnfortunately the newer \\ac{MPI} features, such as one sided, persistent or partitioned communication operations have not yet been widely adopted.\nOne reason for the lack of adoption of modern \\ac{MPI} features may be a limited knowledge of new features by the \\ac{MPI} programmer.\nProgrammers first need to learn the basic concepts of \\ac{MPI} which where already established in the first \\ac{MPI} version, as they from the basis of the more complex modern MPI features.\nThis increased complexity of modern \\ac{MPI} is reflected in the standard document, as\nthe standard document has grown from 238 pages for the first version of \\ac{MPI} \\cite{mpi10} to 1139 pages for the most recent major version 4.0 \\cite{mpi4}.\n\nMost applications can be expressed by only relying on the old \"{}standard\"{} feature-set of \\ac{MPI}.\nApart from one sided operations, most modern \\ac{MPI} operations, such as persistent or partitioned ones can be conceived as specialized versions of the already existent ones, that are designed to be more efficient in certain usage scenarios.\nBut as the \"{}standard\"{} \\ac{MPI} operations do the job ``just fine\", there is no strong incentive to further study \\ac{MPI}, after learning the basics, before putting it to practice.\nThis is especially relevant, considering that the\nperformance benefit of new features was successfully demonstrated in academia, but not yet arrived in widespread \\ac{MPI} implementations.\n\nOn the other hand: As most users actually use the \"{}standard\"{} features of \\ac{MPI}, it is of importance for the implementors to provide support for those operations as efficient as possible.\nThis means that there is only limited incentive for the \\ac{MPI} implementors to do the engineering effort required to fully exploit the performance benefit of modern \\ac{MPI} operations, since only very limited number of users would currently benefit from it.\nThis creates a `chicken and egg\"{}-situation, as illustrated in  \\cref{fig:cycle}.\n\n\nAs an additional hurdle to overcome, programming correct \\ac{MPI} operations can become quite challenging.\nIn addition to the inherent complexity of distributed memory computing, the \\ac{MPI} libraries themselves only provide minimal error checking capabilities.\nUnfortunately, the \\ac{MPI} \\ac{API} is quite error prone. For example the user needs to specify the message buffer, message length and datatype by hand. Here, the programmer can by mistake e.g. specify a wrong datatype leading to data corruption or (probably even worse) a silent error resulting in wrong results.\nAs the usage of advanced \\ac{MPI} is more involved, this problem is especially present for advanced \\ac{MPI} features.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\begin{tikzpicture}[-latex,>=stealth',every label/.append style={rectangle, font=\\fontsize{5}{5}\\selectfont}]\t\t\t\n%text\n\\node (A1) at (0,0)  {\\color{BrickRed}No use of modern MPI};\n\\node (A2) at (-4,-2)  {No incentive to optimize implementation};\n\\node (A3) at (0,-4)  {\\color{BrickRed}No highly optimized implementations};\n\\node (A4) at (+4,-2)  {No incentive to adopt new features};\t\t\n%control flow\n\\draw[->, line width=1mm] (A1) -- (A2) ;\n\\draw[->, line width=1mm] (A2) -- (A3) ;\n\\draw[->, line width=1mm] (A3) -- (A4) ;\n\\draw[->, line width=1mm] (A4) -- (A1) ;\t\t\t\n\\end{tikzpicture}\n\\caption{Illustration of the ``chicken and egg\"{}-situation for adoption of new \\ac{MPI} features}\n\\label{fig:cycle}\n\\end{figure}\n\n%TODO LAYOUT\n\\newpage\nIn order to tackle this problem, this thesis makes the following relevant contributions illustrated in \\cref{fig:cycle-good}:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item In depth understanding of current \\ac{MPI} usage patterns in \\cref{sec:mpi-usage}\n\\item Introducing a \\ac{MPI} Correctness Benchmark to facilitate the development and enhancement of \\ac{MPI} Correctness tools that will aid developers to write correct \\ac{MPI} applications in \\cref{sec:correct}.\n\\item Aiding developers to utilize new modern \\ac{MPI} features with a compiler assisted approach, that requires no additional effort by the programmers in \\cref{sec:modernization}.\n\\item Further showcasing the potential performance benefit from using the newer \\ac{MPI} features by exploiting compiler knowledge in \\cref{sec:general-optimization}.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nThis synopsis is then summarized in \\cref{sec:conclusion}, followed by the publications that are part of this cumulative dissertation, presented in \\cref{sec:paper:mpi-usage} to \\cref{sec:paper:mpi-fnattrs}.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[!b]\n\\begin{tikzpicture}[-latex,>=stealth',every label/.append style={rectangle, font=\\fontsize{5}{5}\\selectfont}]\t\t\t\n%text\n\\node (A1) at (0,0)  {\\color{ForestGreen}More use of modern MPI};\n\\node (A2) at (-4,-2)  {\\makecell[l]{Showcase additional performance benefit\\\\  (\\cref{sec:general-optimization})}};\n\\node (A3) at (0,-4)  {\\color{ForestGreen}More optimized implementations};\n\\node (A4) at (+4.5,-2)  {\\makecell[l]{Ease adoption through better tools (\\cref{sec:correct})\\\\ and compiler-based modernization (\\cref{sec:modernization})}};\t\t\n%control flow\n\\draw[->, line width=1mm] (A1) -- (A2) ;\n\\draw[->, line width=1mm] (A2) -- (A3) ;\n\\draw[->, line width=1mm] (A3) -- (A4) ;\n\\draw[->, line width=1mm] (A4) -- (A1) ;\t\t\t\n\\end{tikzpicture}\n\\caption[Illustration of this thesis contributions]{Illustration of this thesis contributions to tackle the problem illustrated in \\cref{fig:cycle}}\n\\label{fig:cycle-good}\n\\end{figure}\n\nList all acronyms in the text"

This step makes sure that we are able to automatically analyze the source code, even if different Programmers follow different style guidelines.\nNext, we collect all \\ac{MPI} calls, based on their name. \nThis step is similar to \\citeauthor{2019:laguna:mpi-study} study.\nIn our study, we additionally extract and categorize the Arguments for every \\ac{MPI} call in the source code.\nFor instance, the first and second parameter of a \\code{MPI_Send} operation are categorized as \\code{BUFFER} and \\code{NUM\\_ELEMENTS}, respectively.\nThen we resolve macro definitions (4) and try to cross reference the arguments. this means that we look for e.g. a Datatype argument being used in a Type creation function, \\texttt{MPI\\_{}Type\\_{}commit} and a communication operations, in order to determine the function used to create a user defined datatype.\nAll the collected data is then stored into a database, for later analysis and visualization (5).\n\nthe details of this analysis process are presented in \\cref{sec:paper:mpi-usage}.\nIn order to allow for easy reproducability and re-evaluation, to check for changing usage patterns in the future,\nWe implemented a GitHub continuous integration pipeline to run the evaluation.\nThis continuous integration pipeline showcases exactly how to reproduce the results.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!tb]\n\t\\centering\n\t%  trim={<left> <lower> <right> <upper>}\n\t\\includegraphics[width=0.83\\linewidth,trim=0.9cm 13cm 9.5cm 1cm,clip]{media/01-mpi-usage/toolchain.pdf}\n\t\\caption[MPI Analysis Tool]{Our analysis tool chain consists of the following steps.\n\t\t\\begin{enumi}\n\t\t\t\\item Downloaded HPC codes are analyzed per source file (\\fortran, \\cl, \\cppl).\n\t\t\t\\item The code is normalized by removing code comments and formatting the code.\n\t\t\t\\item Matched \\ac{MPI} calls are classified w.r.t.\\ our \\ac{MPI} feature categories.

results and see if \\ac{MPI} usage patterns have evolved since \\citeauthor{2019:laguna:mpi-study}'s study.\nOur study was able to mostly reproduce the results of \\citeauthor{2019:laguna:mpi-study}, this means that we detected no significant change regarding \\ac{MPI} usage.\nThe usage frequency of different \\ac{MPI} features is shown in \\cref{fig:mpi-usage-features}.\nWe see that all applications use at least one collective operation, with \\texttt{MPI\\_{}Allreduce} being the most commonly used one.\nFor point to point operations, we see that most operations are non-bloking.\nBut other communication operations such as persistent or partitioned operations (see \\cref{sec:partitioning}) are not commonly used.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!tb]\n\t% % trim={left bottom right

which is shown in \\cref{tab:mpi-usage-version}.\nNotabely, since \\citeauthor{2019:laguna:mpi-study}'s study, no analyzed application has adopted the most recent version \\ac{MPI} 4.0.\n\nIn addition to show that the general \\ac{MPI} usage patterns have not changed since \\citeauthor{2019:laguna:mpi-study}'s study, our refined code analysis approach is also able to extract more in depth knowledge about \\ac{MPI} usage patterns.\nAn example can be seen in \\cref{fig:mpi-usage-datatype}.\nOne trend we observe is that in collective double and int datatypes are more prevalent than the other types compared to Point to point or file-I/O operations.\nDerived datatypes however are rarely used in collective operations.\nTheir use is larger in file-I/O.\n\\texttt{MPI\\_{}BYTE} is also less used in collective but very often used for file-I/O operations.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[!htb]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\begin{subfigure}[b]{\\textwidth}\n\t\t\\centering\n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{media/01-mpi-usage/pt2pt_datatypes.pdf}\n\t\t\\caption{\\emph{PtP}

usage is quite limited: only $\\approx3\\%$ of point to point operation use \\texttt{MPI\\_ANY\\_SOURCE} and only $\\approx1\\%$ use \\texttt{MPI\\_ANY\\_TAG}. \nThis means that the assertions explained in \\cref{sec:assertions} will apply to many applications.\nThe full results of our study, including additional relevant figures are presented in \\cref{sec:paper:mpi-usage}."

different processes is quite complex.\nThe programmer not only need to implement correct application logic on one process but additionally need to proper synchronize all processes, distribute the problem to different processes without major load imbalance, etc.\nAll of this has to be achieved without the need for excessive communication, such that the communication overhead stays reasonable.\nIn order to achieve this, the programmer need to learn the semantics of the different operations \\ac{MPI} offers, in order to use the correctly.\nApart form the inherent complexity of programming a distributed applications, where many things happen in parallel, the \\ac{API} of \\ac{MPI} itself may also be considered error prone.\nFor example, in an \\texttt{MPI\\_Send}, the user explicitly has to specify the number of elements to send and their datatype.\nThis may be error prone and lead to an additional maintenance burden, as the user may specified the wrong datatype.\nConsider or example an application is using double precision numbers and the programmer want to try single precision, in order to evaluate if a performance increase justifies a loss of precision in the given application.\nIn this case, the programmer may easily miss to change the datatype to \\texttt{MPI\\_{}FLOAT}, which lead to a mismatch between the buffer size and the size of the message to be send, potentially causing an invalid memory access, as illustrated in \\cref{lst:dtype-missmatch-example}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\begin{minted}[linenos,escapeinside=||,highlightlines={}]{c}\nfloat* buf = malloc(10 * sizeof(float));\n// initialize the message buffer\nMPI_Send(buf, 10, MPI_DOUBLE, dest, tag, MPI_COMM_WORLD);\n\\end{minted}\n%\t\\vspace{-0.5cm}\n\\captionof{lstlisting}[Example of a Datatype missmatch]{Example of a Datatype missmatch between the send buffer (float) and the \\ac{MPI} datatype (double).}\n\\label{lst:dtype-missmatch-example}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nIn order to help the programmer to correctly use \\ac{MPI}, several \\ac{MPI} correctness tools have been developed, which are discussed in the next section.\n\n\\section{MPI correctness tools}\n\nIn general, two different kinds of Tools for checking for programming errors in \\ac{MPI} Programs have been developed: static and dynamic ones.\n\n\\paragraph{Static Correctness Checking tools} analyze the source code, or some other representation, e.g., the LLVM \\ac{IR}, of the \\ac{MPI} program, without executing it.\n\nOne such tool is MPI-Checker~\\cite{droste2015mpi}, of which some checks are now available within clang-tidy.\\footnote{clang-tidy, available as part of Clang/LLVM: \\url{https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy}}\nIt performs its analyses on the program's abstract syntax tree built by the Clang compiler.\nHence, it can detect type violations, e.g., passing a \\code{long int} argument where an \\code{int} is expected.\nSince the tool has knowledge about the \\ac{MPI} semantics, it can also detect certain mismatching argument combinations.\nAnother static Analysis tool is \\acr{PARCOACH}. \\cite{saillard2014parcoach,2016:saillard:parcoach}. \n\\ac{PARCOACH} builds a \\ac{CFG} from the LLVM \\ac{IR}, in order to detect errors related to the control flow, such as a collective operation not being called from all ranks.\n\\ac{PARCOACH} also has capabilities to detect data races for \\ac{RMA} operations.\n%For this it also implements an additional dynamic analysis at the program runtime, in order to improve the error detection capabilities \\cite{saillard2014parcoach,parcoach23improvingrma}.\n\n\\paragraph{Dynamic Correctness Checking tools} provide special libraries that are loaded when executing the target application.\nThese libraries wrap the regular \\ac{MPI} function calls and intercept them at runtime.\nHence, the tools first perform the error checking and then continue with invoking the original \\ac{MPI} implementation for the actual communication.\nIn order to implement tools, that intercept \\ac{MPI} calls, the \\ac{MPI} standard offers PMPI.\nThe most prominent state of the art dynamic tools are \\acr{MUST} \\cite{hilbrich2010must} and \\acr{ITAC} \\cite{2021:intel:itac}, although \\ac{ITAC} announced end of support for future \\ac{MPI} development.\n\nStatic Analysis tools have the advantage of catching errors early, before execution and can therefore often provide faster feedback.\nOn the other hand for certain complex situations in large scale applications, the capabilities of a static tool to detect all possible errors may be limited.\nTherefore, static tools are often focused on a specific aspect of correct \\ac{MPI} usage.\nDynamic tools on the other hand have the disadvantage, that they often rely on the ``observability'' of an error.\nAs complex distributed application can exhibit a high degree of non-determinism, this may impair the tools error detection rate, if e.g. a deadlock is prevented, because the correct order of operations was present ``by accident'' instead of a correct ordering being enforced by proper synchronization.\nThis is especially relevant in Hybrid MPI+X applications which involve more fine grained parallelism, as discussed in \\cref{sec:hybrid}\n\n\n\n\\section{Previous Practice of Correctness Tool Evaluation}\n\nCorrectness Tools are evaluated with self-written test-cases.\nAs tools have different focus, it is likely  that the given test-cases used for evaluation are developed with this focus in mind.\nAlthough sometimes comparative evaluations are performed, the focus of the test-cases on a specific set of \\ac{MPI} errors make it hard to differentiate what tools are most suited for a specific set of \\ac{MPI} operations present in an application.\nAdditionally, at th test-cases are most often provided by the tool developers themselves, a general assessment how the test cases transfer to the real world usage patterns is missing so far.\nWe will first discuss the general types of \\ac{MPI} errors possible (\\cref{sec:error-types}), before discussing the idea of a Correctness Benchmark in \\cref{sec:mpi-cobe} and how it can be utilized to evaluate th real world applicability of \\ac{MPI} correctness Tools.\n\n\\section{Categorization of MPI Errors}\n\\label{sec:error-types}\nDifferent kinds of programming errors in \\ac{MPI} may lead to different (non-deterministic) failures at runtime.\nIn general, \\ac{MPI} errors can be categorized into three different categories:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\t\\item \\textbf{Single call errors}: These errors are only related to\tlocal \\ac{MPI} functions and can be detected by only analyzing the\tparameters of a given \\ac{MPI} function.\n\t\\item \\textbf{Process-local errors}: These errors often consist of an inconsistency between the local context of a process and\n\tthe parameters of a given \\ac{MPI} call in that process. Thus, the detection of these errors requires analysis of local process information.\n\t\\item \\textbf{Multi-processes errors}: These errors result from the interplay of\n\tmultiple application processes, such as a deadlock.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\n\\paragraph{Single call errors}\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\t\\item Invalid Parameters: This category contains invalid parameters in an \\ac{MPI} call, such as a negative value for a rank.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\paragraph{Process-local errors}\n\\begin{enumerate}[resume]\n\t\\item Resource Leak: Any improper destruction of \\ac{MPI} resources (e.g., datatype, request, communicators) leads to a resource leak.\n\t\\item Initialization of \\ac{MPI}: Wrong initialization or finalization of \\ac{MPI} can lead to errors, e.g., if messages are sent before \\ac{MPI} is initialized.\n\t\\item Request Lifecycle: Request lifecycle errors occur if, e.g., a wait to complete a nonblocking operation is missing.\n\t\\item Local Concurrency: A local concurrency error occurs when a process accesses a memory region asynchronously read or written by \\ac{MPI}. This type of error can eb encountered with nonblocking or one-sided communication. An example would be using a message buffer before the nonblocking operation completes.\n\t\\item Epoch Lifecycle: An epoch lifecycle error occurs when \\ac{MPI} \\ac{RMA} operations are wrongly synchronized by, e.g., mixing different \\ac{RMA} synchronization modes (fences and locks) or performing an \\ac{RMA} operation outside an access epoch.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\paragraph{Multi-processes errors}\n\\begin{enumerate}[resume]\n\t\\item Message Race: Wildcard receive calls can lead to non-deterministic message matching with potential senders, possibly leading to deadlocks.\n\t\\item Parameter Matching: Parameter matching corresponds to \\ac{MPI}\n\tcalls matched with incompatible arguments. An example is a\n\tcollective operation, where the processes do not agree on a root, which can result in a deadlock.\n\t\\item Call Ordering: Wrong ordering of \\ac{MPI} calls can lead to a call mismatch, e.g., when all processes call a receive operation before any process calls a send operation, resulting in a deadlock.\n\t\\item Global Concurrency: Global concurrency errors occur if two or\n\tmore processes access the same memory region (at least one\n\taccess is a write). An example would be two concurrent \\texttt{MPI\\_{}Put} operations accessing the same memory region at the target process.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nFor detailed code examples of the different error classes, we refer to \\cref{sec:paper:cobe}.\nSome Literature considered a deadlock as its own error class.\nCITATIONS ABOUT DEADLOCK DETECTION\nIn our classification we consider a deadlock to be a symptom of another error, like a message race.\n\n\\section{MPI Correctness Benchmarks}\n\\label{sec:mpi-cobe}\n\nIn order to compare and evaluate different correctness tools, a correctness Benchmark suite can be used.\nSuch Benchmark also exist for other Programming Models besides \\ac{MPI}.\nFor example DataRaceBench \\cite{2017:liao:dataracebench}, for testing \\ac{OpenMP} data race detection tools, or RMARaceBench \\cite{rmaracebench}, for data race detection tools with \\ac{RMA} operations, such as SHMEM \\cite{OpenSHMEM15} or GASPI \\cite{GASPI171}.\n\nThe idea of such structured benchmarks to evaluate and compare different tools is not unique to the field of \\ac{HPC}.\nExamples are benchmarks to evaluate static-analysis tools for web security~\\cite{nunes2018benchmarking}, as well as benchmarks for design pattern~\\cite{fontana2012dpb} or clone detection tools~\\cite{svajlenko2014evaluating}.\nThe Rigorous Examination of Reactive Systems~(RERS) challenge~\\cite{rers} provides a forum to compare solvers for various program verification tasks.\nIt is comprised of sequential linear temporal logic~(LTL)~\\cite{1977:pnuelli:ltl} and reachability solvers, and, more recently~\\cite{2018:jasper:rers}, parallel LTL and computation tree logic~(CTL)~\\cite{1982:clarke:ctl} solvers.\n\nFor \\ac{MPI}, the Correctness Benchmakrks MPI-CorrBench (\\cref{sec:cobe}), MPI-BugsInitiative (\\cref{sec:mbi}) and MPI-BugBench (\\cref{sec:bugbench}) where developed.\n\\subsection{MPI-Corrbench}\n\\label{sec:cobe}\n\nMPI-CorrBench was developed as the first \\ac{MPI} correctness benchmark for structured evaluation of \\ac{MPI} correctness checking tools.\nMPI-Corrbench contains 510 small-scale unit-test like C language tests with 202 correct and 308 incorrect codes.\nThe correct test cases have been extracted from an \\ac{MPI} library implementation test set.\nThe incorrect codes, on the other hand, have been hand-written.\nEach incorrect test contains a brief description of the error.\nIn addition to the small scale unit tests, MPI-Corrbench also includes three well-known (C/C\\texttt{++}) \\ac{HPC} mini-apps with manually introduced specific errors, to test the tools with larger codes.\n\n\\subsection{MPI-Bugs Initiative}\n\\label{sec:mbi}\nThe MPI-Bugs Initiative \\cite{mpibugsini} was developed by \\citeauthor{mpibugsini} independently of MPI-Corrbench.\n%The author of this thesis did not contribute to the MPI-Bugs Initiative.\nThe collaborative integration of MPI-CorrBench and MPI-Bugs Initiative resulted in MPI-BugBench, as part of this thesis, as discussed in \\cref{sec:bugbench}.\n\n\nMPI-Bugs Initiative \\cite{mpibugsini} contains 1668 small scale unit-test like C language codes, including 682 correct and 986 incorrect codes. \nIn contrast\u00b4 to MPI-Corrbench, the MPI-Bugs Initiative \\cite{mpibugsini} generates the testcodes using several templates for the various \\ac{MPI} categories.\nThe templates contain placeholder tokens that get replaced by (in-)correct usage of \\ac{MPI} calls to generate the final test case.\nEach test defines a header that describes the intent of each code and specifies how to execute and evaluate it. \n\n\\subsection{MPI-BugBench}\n\\label{sec:bugbench}\nMPI-BugBench evolved from MPI-CorrBench and MPI-BugsInitiative as a collaborative effort.\nIt improves the generation of test-cases, in order to test for more possible real world scenarios.\nThis means that, in contrast to both previous benchmark, MPI-BugBench contains multiple different example of the same error.\nFor example a datatype mismatch between \\texttt{float} and \\texttt{int} as well as a mismatch between \\texttt{float} and \\texttt{double}.\nThe reason is, that for a correctness tool, the mismatch between \\texttt{float} and \\texttt{int} may result in a message of the same size, whereas the mismatch between \\texttt{float} and \\texttt{double} results in a message of a different size.\nA correctness toll therefore may need to implement different strategies to detect te same error (e.g. datatype mismatch) in different manifestations.\nIn order to enhance the real world applicability, the tools implementation is therefore tested against several different manifestations of the same error.\n\nThis, however, leads to a very high number of test-cases: MPI-BugBench can generate more than 4 million testcases.\nAs such exhaustive testing requires a lot of runtime, the number of test-cases to generate can be reduced using different levels.\nlevel 1 contains only one particular example for each error.\nlevel 2 contains only errors in usage patterns found in the real world, whereas level 3 contains errors in all possible usage patterns.\nlevel 2 and 3 are additionally segmented into 2.1 and 2.2.\n2.1 includes erroneous combinations of \\ac{MPI} usage, such that each usage pattern is used at least once, whereas 2.2 contains all possible erroneous combinations.\nMPI-BugBench is designed with the usage level 2.1 \"Sufficient coverage of Real world usage patterns\" as the default level leading to $\\approx2000$ test-cases, in order to strive a balance between efficiency and a thorough tool evaluation.\n\nTesting the state of the art correctness tools with \\textsc{MPI-BugBench} shows that the tools are already able to detect most of the errors present.\n\\cref{fig:mbb-results} shows the capabilities of \\ac{MUST}, \\ac{ITAC}, and \\ac{PARCOACH} to detect the errors present in \\textsc{MPI-BugBench}.\nA tool can either correctly detect an error (true positive, TP), wrongfully detect an error, when there is none (false positive, FP), correctly report no error for a correct program (true negative, TN), or wrongfully report no error for an erroneous program (false neagtive, FN).\nAdditionally, some test-cases lead to compiler errors (CE) for \\ac{ITAC}, as \\ac{MPI} 4.0 features are not supported by the used \\ac{MPI} implementation.\nIn rare cases, the tool itself leads to a runtime error (RE).\nRuntime errors of the tool are only counted on correct test-cases, as the error present may lead to a crash by itself already, and it is therefore hard to argue if the tool lead to a crash or the actual error present.\n\nIn \\cref{fig:mbb-results}, we see that many errors are already detected by the correctness tools.\nNevertheless, we see that the tools are not perfect. \nFor example, \\ac{MUST} and \\ac{ITAC} are not able to detect some erroneous usages with less frequently used \\ac{MPI} calls or datatypes.\nThe low performance of \\ac{PARCOACH} on point to point operations is expected, as it is not designed for those operations, it focuses on  collective and \\ac{RMA} operations instead.\nDetailed Results are presented in \\cref{sec:paper:mpi-bugbench}\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[!tb]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{media/02-cobe/results_per_cat.pdf}\n\\begin{flushleft}\n\t\\scriptsize\n\tCE:

\\textsc{MPI-BugBench}]{Tool evaluation using \\textsc{MPI-BugBench} including a breakdown for each \\ac{MPI} feature category.}\n\t\\label{fig:mbb-results}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Real world applicability of Correctness benchmarks}\n\\label{sec:real-world-cobe}\n\nIn order to Assess the real world applicability of a \\ac{MPI} Correctness-Benchmark, we propose a scoring mechanism, that calculates the percentage of real world usage patterns covered in the correctness benchmark.\nFor this \\ac{MPI} usage pattern scoring, we consider:\n\\begin{enumi}\n\t\\item The \\ac{MPI} call,\n\t\\item the \\emph{Datatype} and \\emph{Reduction Operator},\n\t\\item the \\emph{Count}\n\t\\item and if wildcards, such as \\texttt{\\small{}ANY\\_TAG} are used; \n\t\\item for collective operations, the root \\emph{Rank} is also important to the usage pattern.\n\\end{enumi}\n\nTo be counted towards usage scoring, for each individual \\ac{MPI} call in the real-world dataset, the aforementioned aspects must be present in the \\ac{MPI} correctness benchmark.\nAdditionally, the score for each usage pattern is based on its frequency in our real-world dataset.\nAs the dataset contains operations with varying arguments, a 100\\% score requires all operations for each \\ac{MPI} feature category to be present with all arguments in the correctness benchmark.\nConsider a dataset with six scatter operations and four broadcast operations.\nIf all six scatter operations fully match, but only one out of four broadcast operations match (e.g., one uses \\texttt{\\small{}MPI\\_FLOAT} and the others use \\texttt{\\small{}MPI\\_DOUBLE}), the score of the benchmark would be 70\\% for collectives.\nThe full details of this scoring workflow are explained in \\cref{sec:paper:real-world-cobe} and the dataset of the real world usage pattern is described in \\cref{sec:mpi-usage}.\n\nThe scores achieved by the \\ac{MPI} Correctness Benchmarks \\ac{COBE}, \\ac{MBI} and \\ac{MBB} are shown in \\cref{fig:real-world}.\nwe see, that the real world coverage score of MPI-BugBench (75\\% overall) is better than for the other correctness Benchmarks.\nThe current lack of coverage for the \\emph{Types} category is explained in a surprisingly high number of conversion functions like \\texttt{Type\\_{}f2c}, which the benchmark currently does not cover as Fortran is not supported.\nFor the \\texttt{other} category, the lack of coverage is mostly due to \\ac{MPI} I/O which is currently not covered by \\textsc{MPI-BugBench}.\nThis high coverage can be achieved by generating multiple instances of the same error, such that all different \\ac{MPI} usage patterns are covered, as explained in \\cref{sec:bugbench}.\nThis means that the generation of test-cases for \\ac{MBB} is guided by real world dataset.\nBut one can replace our dataset of the \\ac{MPI} usage patterns in general, with a dataset of the usage patterns for a specific application.\nThis allows for tailored evaluation of the correctness tools, if they support precisely the usage patterns used in any given application.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[!tb]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=0.6\\textwidth]{media/02-cobe/plotsFaulty_testcases.pdf}\n\t\\caption[Coverage of Real world \\ac{MPI} usage patterns by \\ac{COBE}, \\ac{MBI}, and \\ac{MBB}]{Coverage of Real world \\ac{MPI} usage patterns by \\ac{COBE}, \\ac{MBI}, and \\ac{MBB}.}\n\t\\label{fig:real-world}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{Correctness Checking for Hybrid MPI Applications}\n\\label{sec:hybrid}\n\nAs discussed in \\cref{sec:mpi-usage}, \\ac{MPI} is often used in conjunction with other programming models (MP+X) such as \\ac{OpenMP} (MPI+OpenMP).\nThis leads to more complexity, as the developer not only need to understand the semantics of each programming model individually but additionally needs to be aware of the interplay of both models.\nThis may lead to even more complicated errors.\ntherefore tools support in these situations is also strongly desirable.\nAs explained in the next section however, a combination of a \\emph{pure} \\ac{MPI} correctness checking tool with a \\emph{pure} \\ac{OpenMP} tool is not sufficient to detect all erroneous usages resulting from the interplay of \\ac{MPI} and \\ac{OpenMP}.\n\n\\subsection{Categorization of Hybrid Errors}\nThe categorization of possible \\ac{MPI} errors are discussed in \\cref{sec:error-types}.\nThis section first discusses the categories of \\ac{OpenMP} errors that are relevant for \\ac{MPI} usage, before detailing the \\emph{new} classes of errors arising from the interplay of \\ac{MPI} and \\ac{OpenMP}.\n\\subsubsection{OpenMP Related errors}\n\nIn previous work~\\cite{suss2005common,omperrors2014,cramer2016extending}, \\ac{OpenMP} issues and classifications thereof have been presented.\n\\ac{OpenMP} errors can stem from, e.g., syntactical problems like misspelling a compiler directive or semantic defects that may manifest as, e.g., a deadlock during execution.\nWe briefly summarize the classification of relevant \\ac{OpenMP} errors based on \\citeauthor{omperrors2014} \\cite{omperrors2014}.\nWe only include those classes of errors that are relevant when combining with \\ac{MPI}.\nThere exist other errors, like the ``violation of the single entry single exit principle\" of an \\ac{OpenMP} parallel region that do not add additional complexity when combining with \\ac{MPI}.\n\n\\paragraph{Uninitialized memory}  is a more general concern as using uninitialized values may lead to undefined behaviour.\n\\citeauthor{omperrors2014} \\cite{omperrors2014} originality denoted \\emph{unallocated} memory, in our opinion however, uninitialized memory is more general.\nIn particular, the data sharing semantics of \\ac{OpenMP} allow making variables private to each thread inside a parallel region (the variable is, thus, local to the thread's stack).\nAny prior initialization outside the parallel region is ignored, and it is the user's responsibility to initialize the value inside the parallel region,~\\cite[\\sectionname~\\(2.21.3\\)~\\cl/\\cppl]{openmpstd}:\n\\begin{quote}\n\t\\enquote{The new list item is initialized, or has an undefined initial value, as if it had been locally declared without an initializer.}\n\\end{quote}\n\n\n\\paragraph{Wrong Assumption about parallelism} may cause issues, e.g., expecting the number of threads is always greater than two for a parallel region.\nThis can lead to deadlock for example, when one \\ac{OpenMP} task is ``stuck'', waiting for a particular event to happen but no other threads are around to trigger that event.\n\n\n\\paragraph{Race conditions} describe scenarios where the result of an operation depends on the order of execution in a multi-threaded program.\nTypically, it can be defined as two or more threads accessing a shared resource, where at least one of these threads executes write access.\nHence, this scenario, when the shared resource is not protected by synchronization routines such as an \\ac{OpenMP} \\emph{lock} results in undefined behaviour.\n\n\\paragraph{A Deadlock}  is a program state that can not make \\emph{progress} anymore.\nTypically, a wrong order of locking for mutual exclusion can lead to deadlocks of participating threads.\n\n\\subsubsection{Hybrid Errors}\n\\cref{tab:error-compare} compares relevant classes of \\ac{MPI} errors and \\ac{OpenMP} errors.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\t\\centering\n\t\\begin{tabular}{cc|c}\n\t\t\\ac{MPI} & \\ac{OpenMP} & Hybrid\\\\\n\t\t\\hline\n\t\t&Assumption about parallelism&Wrong initialization or

program, one  need use the proper threading level.\n\\ac{MPI} defines four threading levels:\n\\begin{itemize}[align=left]\n\\item[\\texttt{MPI\\_THREAD\\_SINGLE}] Each process has only one executing thread, it behaves the same as a standard single-threaded \\ac{MPI} program using \\code{MPI\\_Init}.\n\\item[\\texttt{MPI\\_THREAD\\_FUNNELED}] Only the thread which initialized \\ac{MPI} executes \\ac{MPI} calls.\n\\item[\\texttt{MPI\\_THREAD\\_SERIALIZED}] Any thread can call \\ac{MPI}, but only one thread at a time.\n\\item[\\texttt{MPI\\_THREAD\\_MULTIPLE}] All threads can make \\ac{MPI} calls concurrently.\n\t\n\\end{itemize}\nIn order to determine the appropriate threading level, one needs to understand the semantics of the used \\ac{OpenMP} constructs.For example, if all \\ac{MPI} calls are executed inside of a \\texttt{pragma omp master}, \\texttt{MPI\\_THREAD\\_FUNNELED} is a sufficient threading level.\nBut if all \\ac{MPI} calls are instead inside of a \\texttt{pragma omp single}, at least \\texttt{MPI\\_THREAD\\_SERIALIZED} need to be specified.\n\n\\paragraph{Data Races} can happen at the \\ac{MPI} or \\ac{OpenMP} level.\nThis means that data races can also happen between \\ac{MPI} and \\ac{OpenMP}.\nAn example is the use of a non-blocking operation, where the buffer gets overwritten by another thread, while the operation is in progress.\nA \\emph{pure} \\ac{OpenMP} tool that does not know about the \\ac{MPI} semantics may not detect this error, similar to a \\emph{pure} \\ac{MPI} tool, that does not handle multiple dfferent threads.\n\n\\paragraph{The ordering of MPI calls} is also more complex when combining with \\ac{OpenMP}.\nin the single threaded case, the order of \\ac{MPI} calls is well-defined.  \nHowever, between multiple threads in an \\ac{MPI} process, there are no strict ordering guarantees.\nThe standard specifies that for concurrent \\ac{MPI} operations, the \\enquote{outcome will be as if the calls executed in some order, even if their execution is interleaved}~\\cite[\\sectionname~\\(11.6.1\\)]{mpi4}.\nThe user is responsible for avoiding orderings that lead to erroneous program behavior, such as deadlocks.\n\n\\paragraph{Wrong memory usage} can be the result of not being aware that e.g. the \\code{private} directive for variables does not create private value copies for each thread, instead they are put on the thread's local stack as if \\enquote{it had been locally declared without an initializer}, \\seeciref{\\sectionname~\\(2.21.3\\)}{openmpstd}. \nHence, communicating and using such a value without explicit initialization inside the parallel region may lead to undefined behavior in \\cl/\\cppl.\n\n\n\\subsection{Hybrid MPI-Corrbench}\nBased on the errors that can occur due to the interplay of \\ac{OpenMP} and \\ac{MPI}, we developed Hybrid-Corrbench with 103 test-cases.\nAs the interplay of \\ac{MPI} and \\ac{OpenMP} can lead to nondeterministic ordering of operations, we executed each test-case at least ten times, with various interleavings, some that make an erronenous ordering likely and others where it is unlikely.\nWe tracked if an erronenous ordering was observable in a specific interleaving by using vector clocks.\nWe note that a high quality correctness tool should be able to distinguish between a correct ordering ensured by proper means of synchronization and one that occurs ``by chance'', as this indicates a lack of proper synchronization.\nThis means that although the error may not always be observable during execution, all our test programs are erroneous according to the \\ac{MPI} standard.\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}[!tb]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=0.7\\linewidth,trim=0cm .22cm 0cm

The author of this thesis has contributed to \\acr{CATO} in this regard \\cite{squar2020cato}.\n\nThis chapter will demonstrate, that compiler based approaches can also be applied to the most  recent version of the standard: \\ac{MPI} 4.0.\nThe \\ac{MPI} Forum characterizes \\ac{MPI} 4.0 as follows: ``The largest changes [for the 4.0 version of the \\ac{MPI} standard] are the addition of large-count versions of many routines to address the limitations of using an int or INTEGER for the count parameter, persistent collectives, partitioned communications, an alternative way to initialize \\ac{MPI}, application info assertions and improvements to the definitions of error handling\" \\cite{mpi4}.\nIn this chapter, we focus on the usage of application-info assertions and partitioned communications, as these concepts are entirely new to \\ac{MPI}.\n\n\\section{MPI Assertions}\n\\label{sec:assertions}\n\nIn version 4.0 of the \\ac{MPI} standard, several application info assertions were introduced, in order to allow for a more optimized implementation in certain conditions.\nThese assertions can be specified for a communicator to inform the \\ac{MPI} library about specific usage patterns, that may facilitate a more optimized implementation.\nFor instance, the \\texttt{allow\\_overtaking} assertion informs the library, that it is allowed to relax strict message ordering, enabling more optimized implementations, as the usual ordering guarantees of the \\ac{MPI} standard are not needed for correct execution.\n\nIn the remainder of this section, we discuss the different assertions includes in the \\ac{MPI} standard and in which cases the compiler is able to determine that this assertion can be specified for the application, while preserving the applications' correctness.\n\n\\subsection{\\texttt{no\\_any\\_tag} and \\texttt{no\\_any\\_source} Assertions}\n\\label{sec:assert:wildcard}\n\\ac{MPI} provides \\texttt{MPI\\_ANY\\_TAG} and \\texttt{MPI\\_ANY\\_SOURCE} as wildcards in receive operations to match any incoming message, rather than just specific ones.\nHowever, \\citeauthor{dang2016towards} \\cite{dang2016towards} show that matching \\emph{unexpected} messages is particularly costly.\nUsing wildcards results in all messages being treated as \\emph{unexpected}, which negatively impacts matching performance.\nThus, performance may improve if mechanisms for unexpected message matching can be disabled.\n\nThe \\texttt{no\\_any\\_tag} or \\texttt{no\\_any\\_source} assertions can be specified in order to assert the \\ac{MPI} library that the corresponding wildcard is not used, thus  eliminating the need for wildcard matching mechanisms.\nThe compiler analysis is straightforward, requiring only a check for the presence of these predetermined constants in the application.\n\nAs discussed in \\cref{sec:mpi-usage}, the usage of wildcards is rather rare, meaning that many applications could potentially benefit from specifying the no wildcard assertions.\n\n\n\\subsection{\\texttt{allow\\_overtaking} Assertion}\n\\label{sec:allow-overtaking}\nThe semantics of the \\ac{MPI} standard require that messages with the same envelope are received in the same order as they are sent.\nThe \\texttt{allow\\_overtaking} assertion relaxes this requirement, making message order irrelevant for message matching.\nThis enables the \\ac{MPI} library to optimize the communication protocol by eliminating the need to track message order.\n\nThe compiler is able to prove in some cases that such relaxation of message matching semantics is appropriate.\nThe basic idea is that the compiler can show that no two messages with the same envelope are ever in the network simultaneously.\nTherefore, overtaking of messages cannot occur, regardless of whether the \\ac{MPI} library enforces message ordering.\nThis applies to applications that ensure ordering of messages through other \\ac{MPI} synchronization methods, like barriers, rather than relying on message ordering.\nAnalyzing interactions between processes is challenging for the compiler, especially since it does not know the number of processes to begin with.\nHowever, for \\texttt{allow\\_overtaking} assertion, a process-local analysis is sufficient.\nThe compiler only analyzes the ``sender side\"{} of the application.\nIf no two messages that could potentially overtake each other are ever sent, overtaking cannot happen at all.\nMessages sent from different origin processes to the same target process have no defined ordering between them.\nTherefore, such messages are not included in our analysis and a process-local analysis is sufficient.\n\n\nThe details of this analysis are explained in \\cref{sec:paper:mpi-assertions}.\nThe basic idea is that for each message sent, the compiler tries to determine when the corresponding receive operation is finished on the target process.\nThis is done by analyzing the other \\ac{MPI} synchronization used, such as the \\texttt{MPI\\_Barrier}'s present.\nFor a correct and deadlock-free application, the compiler can infer that a message sent before a synchronization, like a barrier, will have been received before that barrier by the target process, as there will be a deadlock otherwise.\nThis implies that any message after the barrier can never overtake a message before the barrier, as the first message has already left the network and arrived at the destination.\nThis analysis is necessary for messages that have a potentially conflicting message envelope, as other messages will be distinguished by envelope instead of message ordering by the application.\n\n\n\\subsection{\\texttt{exact\\_length} Assertion}\n\\label{sec:exact-length}\nIn \\ac{MPI} it is possible to receive an incoming message with a shorter length than indicated by the receive call.\nIn this case, the message is received into the first part of the buffer, while the rest of the buffer is unchanged.\nThis can lead to additional communication overhead.\nFor example, if the actual message being received does not match to the package length of a lower communication layer, the \\ac{MPI} library may need to take extra precaution that the ``leftover\"{} part of the receive buffer is not overwritten, as the \\ac{MPI} standard explicitly requires that.\nThis overhead may be mitigated by using the \\texttt{exact\\_length} assertion, which specifies that all receive operations will receive a message of exactly the indicated length.\n\nIn some cases, the compiler is able to identify that this assertion holds for a given application.\nThe compiler is not able to statically match messages at compile time.\nIn particular, it can often not analyze the target rank of any given message, as the number of processes is not known at compile time.\nHowever, it can sort all send and receive operations into buckets based on message tags.\nThe compiler can check the buckets, if all send and receive operations have the same size argument.\nIn this case, the length of the messages send exactly matches the length of the receive operations.\nThe details of this analysis are presented in \\cref{sec:paper:mpi-assertions}.\n\n\\subsection{Performance Impact of MPI Assertions}\n\nAs the \\ac{MPI} standard states that ``an implementation is free to ignore all\nhints\" \\cite{mpi4}, providing these assertions currently has no performance impact, as implementations simply disregard them due to infrequent usage by applications.\nHowever, given that the analysis for these assertions, described above, adds only a negligible compile-time overhead ($<0.3\\%$), it is advisable to specify these assertions.\nThis can future-proof codes, allowing them to benefit from more optimized \\ac{MPI} implementations that may respect these assertions in the future.\n\nThe potential performance benefit of these assertions has been shown in academia though.\nFor example, \\citeauthor{dang2016towards} show that renouncing from the usage of matching wildcards, i.e. specify the \\texttt{no\\_any\\_tag} and \\texttt{no\\_any\\_source} assertions, can result in up to 3x communication performance improvement in a multithreaded environment \\cite{dang2016towards}.\n\n\n\\section{Automatic Partitioning of MPI Operations}\n\\label{sec:partitioning}\n\nThe 4.0 version of the \\ac{MPI} standard also introduces \\emph{partitioned} point-to-point operations as a new type of operations.\nFor a partitioned operation one message is split into multiple partitions.\nThese operations are designed for use in a multi-threaded environments, where the partitions of a message can be independently contributed by different threads.\nIn this case, having only one message with multiple partitions is preferable to having one message per thread, as some message matching overhead can be saved this way.\nThe other possibility of first joining all the threads together and then starting one joint \\ac{MPI} communication operation has the disadvantage, that the data transfer cannot start right away, once a thread is ready, if this is beneficial for performance.\nBut the semantics of the \\ac{MPI} standard does not mandate that communication happens for each partition immediately.\nTherefore, the implementation can wait until multiple partitions are ready in order to optimally use the available network bandwidth.\n\nAn example of a partitioned operations usage is depicted in \\cref{lst:partitioned}. It is similar to the usage of a persistent point-to-point operation, in that first a request is initialized (line 1 of \\cref{lst:partitioned}) that can than be used multiple times for communication operations.\nIn contrast to persistent operations, however, at the point when \\texttt{MPI\\_Start} is called, no communication takes place yet.\nFor the actual communication to start, the application needs to mark the partitions as ready ( line 5 of \\cref{lst:partitioned}).\nOnce all partitions are marked ready, the completion of the non-blocking data-transfer needs to be ensured e.g. by using \\texttt{MPI\\_Wait}.\n\nFor the receive part, one can check if a certain partition is available using \\texttt{MPI\\_Parrived}.\n\\begin{listing}[t]\n\t\\begin{minted}[linenos,escapeinside=||,highlightlines={}]{c}\nMPI_Psend_init(msg, partitions, count, type, /*...*/ &req);\nMPI_Start(&req);\nfor(i = 0; i < partitions; ++i){ // may be executed in parallel\n\t/* compute and fill partition #i, then mark ready: */\n\tMPI_Pready(i, &req); }\nMPI_Wait(&req);\n\\end{minted}\n%\t\\vspace{-0.5cm}\n\t\\captionof{lstlisting}{Example of a partitioned operation}\n\t\\label{lst:partitioned}\n\\end{listing}\n\n\n\\subsection{Compiler analysis of OpenMP Regions}\nMost of the performance benefits associated with the usage of partitioned operations can only be realized if the sender side utilizes persistent send operation.\nThe \\ac{MPI} standard does allow to match a standard blocking send operation with a partitioned receive operation, but in this case, receiving different partitions at different times is not possible if the sender sends the data in one bulk.\nIf a partitioned send operation is received with a blocking receive operation, the network bandwidth can be optimally utilized, by sending different partitions at different times, as explained above, which constitutes much of the performance benefit associated with the usage of partitioned operations \\cite{grant2019finepoints}. \n\nTherefore, our compiler based approach is limited to partitioning the sender side.\nThis means that a compiler analysis of only the sender side is sufficient.\n\nAs a starting point, we consider the case where all \\ac{OpenMP} threads are joined before sending the message, while the message is computed in a parallel for loop.\nThe other use-case, where multiple messages are sent from all the threads, cannot be covered by our compiler based approach, as the application may need this messages to be distinct for synchronization purposes.\nTherefore, in this case an additional analysis and transformation of the receive side is not necessary.\nAs the usecase of multiple messages being send by different threads requires more effort when  integrating \\ac{OpenMP} and \\ac{MPI}, the other case of the message being send after the join barrier is more prevalent.\n%This is supported by reference to understanding of mpi chapter\n%TODO ANALYSIS OF THREADING_LEVEL REQUIRED!\n\n\n\nThe compiler is in some cases then able to detect that a send operation is eligible for partitioning.\nTo this end, the compiler analyzes all send operations and checks the usage of the message buffer.\nIf the message buffer is only written inside of the \\ac{OpenMP} parallel region, but not after the join barrier, it concludes that this operation can be partitioned.\nThe idea how the compiler can properly partition the operation retaining the correctness of the application is discussed in the following section.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Partitioning of Operations}\n\n\\begin{listing}[!b]\n\\begin{minted}[linenos,escapeinside=||,highlightlines={}]{c}\n// allocate/init msg buffer\nfor(int n = 0; n < num_iter; n++){\n  # pragma omp parallel for\n

partitioning.}\n\\label{lst:after}\n\\end{listing}\n\nWhen \\emph{automatically} partitioning an operation, it is essential that correctness is preserved.\nIn terms of synchronization with the other process no precautions needs to be taken, as a partitioned operation can be matched with any receive operation and the message envelope will still be the same.\n\nAs partitioned operations have a very similar usage as persistent operations, the send operation in question is first transformed into a persistent operation, unless it is already a persistent operation.\nThis step is similar to \\cite{ahmed2017transforming}.\nAn example with a persistent operation is shown in \\cref{lst:before}.\nThe transformed code is illustrated in \\cref{lst:after}.\nIn order to partition the operation, the number of partitions needs to be calculated.\nThe idea is that those partitions are distributed among the different \\ac{OpenMP} threads and so, we use the number of \\ac{OpenMP} threads of the following parallel region as the number of partitions to use.\nThe persistent operation is than transformed into a partitioned one and the \\texttt{MPI\\_Start} call is moved before the parallel region.\nThis is illustrated in line 7 of \\cref{lst:after}.\nThe remaining step is to make sure that the partitions are marked as ready in a correct way, regardless of the parallel loop schedule used.\nThe compiler calculates the memory access pattern of the message buffer inside of the parallel loop, line 3 of \\cref{lst:after}.\nIt use this information to determine which loop iterations are needed for each partition to be ``ready\".\nAs the number of loop iterations may not be known at compile time, the compiler inserts the necessary steps for this calculation to happen when the \\ac{OpenMP} parallel region is created.\nAt runtime, the idea is that each thread basically looks up in a table which partitions correspond to its assigned loop iteration, illustrated in line 12 of \\cref{lst:after}.\nThe lookup table itself is initialized when the partition sizes are calculated, which is illustrated in line 4 in \\cref{lst:after}.\nThis approach works for all kinds of loop schedules.\n\nFor static schedules, this table lookup could theoretically be compiled just-in-time  at the start of the parallel region.\nAs the exact iterations are known, the table lookup can be drastically simplified in cases where the partitions exactly align with the threads, effectively eliminating the need for a table.\nThis was investigated in Laurin Bielich's bachelor-thesis, advised by the author of this thesis.\nUnfortunately, just-in-time compilation is not worth the effort in this context, as the time spent to just-in-time compile an optimized version of the table lookup is in the \\emph{serial} part of the application, whereas the potential performance benefit of removing the table lookup at the end is split across the different threads.\n\nNevertheless, the cost for the necessary table lookup is small ($<1\\%$ of application runtime).\nCompared to the potential performance benefit from using partitioned communication \\cite{grant2015lightweight,grant2019finepoints}, it is worthwhile, to let the compiler automatically partition the operation, even if a manual partitioning of the operations results in a slightly better performance.\n\\citeauthor{grant2019finepoints} \\cite{grant2019finepoints} achieved a performance benefit of $>25\\%$ of communication overhead or $\\approx5\\%$ of total application runtime, by utilizing a prototype implementation of persistent \\ac{MPI} Operations.\nAs there currently is no widespread \\ac{MPI} implementation that provides such an optimized implementation for persistent operations, however, the usage of our compiler transformation currently results in basically the same performance.\n\nThe details are discussed in \\cref{sec:paper:partitioning}.\n\n\n\\subsection{Summary}\nIn this chapter, we discussed how the compiler can be utilized to automatically transform codes to use more modern \\ac{MPI} features.\nWe note that those compiler based approaches do not require any input or effort from the user, keeping the cost of integrating the new \\ac{MPI} features minimal.\nAlthough the compiler may not always make the optimal choices, e.g. in the case of the partition sizes, this serves as valuable a starting point for the user to try out the newer features with minimal effort.\n\nIf the user can see a performance benefit, they may be inclined to learn the more advanced features themselves, in order to optimally exploit them.\nThe subsequent modernization of \\ac{MPI} codes can than be helped and guided by further tools such a an IDE (integrated development environment). \nA prototype of such an IDE plugin that transforms blocking to non-blocking operations was developed in the context of this work, as the master thesis of Sven Donnerhak, advised by the author of this thesis.\nHis code for the IDE plugin is available online: \\url{https://github.com/SvenDo11/mpi-converter}.\n\n\nA compiler-based approach can also serve as incentive for an \\ac{MPI} library developer to provide a highly optimized implementation of an \\ac{MPI} feature.\nThey can advertise a compiler plugin to be used, in order to get optimal performance with their \\ac{MPI} implementation, allowing them to out-compete competing \\ac{MPI} implementations in certain usage scenarios."

sketched in \\cref{fig:env-matching}.\nMessages are transferred with an envelope.\nThis envelope is essential for distinguishing between different messages, ensuring that each message is received by the correct receive operation and in turn placed in the appropriate receive buffer.\nThe \\ac{MPI} standard defines that a message envelope is defined by: \n\\begin{enumi}\n\t\\item The source and destination processes,\n\t\\item the \\ac{MPI} communicator used and\n\t\\item the user-specified message tag.\t\n\\end{enumi}\nAn incoming message is then only received by a \\texttt{MPI\\_{}Tecv} operation that matches all components of the envelope.\nIf multiple messages with the same envelope are used, the \\ac{MPI} standard requires, that the order in which the messages are sent is the same order in which they are received (see also \\cref{sec:allow-overtaking}).\nThis matching semantics is crucial for writing correct \\ac{MPI} applications, as it allows messages to be used for synchronization.\nAs sketched in \\cref{fig:env-matching}, this matching semantics lead to communication overhead, as the message envelope needs to be handled in addition to the actual data transfer.\n\n\\begin{listing}[t]\n\\begin{minted}[linenos,escapeinside=||,highlightlines={}]{c}\nMPI_Send_init(buffer, count, type, tag, dest, &req);\nMPI_Recv_init(buffer, count, type, tag, src,

of a persistent operation}\n\\label{lst:persistent}\n\\end{listing}\n\nThis message matching also applies to persistent operations.\nAn example of the usage of persistent \\ac{MPI} operations is shown in \\cref{lst:persistent}.\nFor a persistent operation, a request handle is created (lines 1-2 of \\cref{lst:persistent}).\nAt this point, no communication occurs, as the communication starts with a call to \\texttt{MPI\\_{}Start} (lines 4-5 of \\cref{lst:persistent}), which is equivalent of using an \\texttt{Isend} or \\texttt{Irecv} operation, respectively.\nAs usual, a non-blocking operation completion needs to be ensured by using \\texttt{MPI\\_{}Wait} or an equivalent \\ac{MPI} usage like \\texttt{MPI\\_{}Test}.\nAs indicated with the for loop (line 3 of \\cref{lst:persistent}), the idea of persistent operations is that the request created can be re-used multiple times.\nAs the parameters defining the message envelope are only specified at the initialization of the request, the envelope does not change when the request is being reused.\n\nThis could mean that, theoretically, the same persistent send/receive operation pair will match for all repetitions of the communication and performing the message matching by the \\ac{MPI} implementation is superfluous in these cases.\nIn practice, however, the \\ac{MPI} library can \\emph{not} disable the superfluous message matching for persistent \\ac{MPI} operations.\nThe reason is, that the \\ac{MPI} standard does not require, that a persistent send operation is matched with a persistent receive operation.\nIn this case, as well as in the case of using matching wildcards, the \\ac{MPI} library must perform the proper matching procedures.\n%TODO reverenz kap allow overtaking as matching by order is necessary\nIn the next section, we will present possible optimizations, when matching a persistent send operation with a persistent receive counterpart, while explaining how the compiler can identify these cases in \\cref{sec:compmatch}.\n\n\\subsection{Matching of Persistent Operations}\n\\label{sec:optimization-porential}\n\nWhen we can be certain that a persistent send operation will be matched with exactly one persistent receive counterpart, communication overhead can be saved.\nAfter it is established which two persistent operations match, at the first message exchange, further message matching is superfluous and can be disabled.\nThis is especially beneficial, as message matching is, especially in the multi-threaded case, a large part of the communication overhead \\cite{flajslik2016mitigating}.\nOther parts of the overhead for message transfer can also be saved, especially for larger messages.\nUsually larger messages are sent via a rendezvous protocol employing \\ac{RMA} as the means of actually transferring the message.\nThis usually involves additional overhead, for example for process synchronization, exchange of \\ac{RMA} access tokens and registration of message buffers for \\ac{RMA} transfer.\nAs not only the envelope but also the message buffer's location do not change between different usages of the same persistent request, significant parts of this overhead can also be saved.\n\nWe propose an optimized \"two-sided\" rendezvous protocol in order to transfer the data with as little overhead as possible.\nOne main feature of this protocol is that it is not pre-determined, which communication partner actually initiates the \\ac{RMA} data transfer of the message contents.\nThis is illustrated in \\cref{fig:receiver,fig:sender}, which show the protocol in case the sender or receiver arrives first.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!tb]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\begin{minipage}{0.49\\linewidth}\n\t\t\\centering\n\t\t\\resizebox{1.0\\linewidth}{!}{\\input{media/04-compiler-opt/receiver.tikz}}\n\t\t\\captionof{figure}{Illustration of the two-sided\\\\ rendezvous, in case sender\\\\ arrives first}%\n\t\t\\label{fig:receiver}\t\n\t\\end{minipage}\n\t\\begin{minipage}{0.49\\linewidth}\n\t\t\\centering\n\t\t\\resizebox{1.0\\linewidth}{!}{\\input{media/04-compiler-opt/sender.tikz}}\n\t\t\\captionof{figure}{Illustration of the two-sided\\\\ rendezvous, in case receiver\\\\ arrives first}%\n\t\t\\label{fig:sender}\t\n\t\\end{minipage}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIf a process arrives at the start of the communication, it first checks an agreed-upon memory location to see if the communication partner is ready for the data transfer.\nIn this case, it initiates the \\ac{RMA} data-transfer with the network device and continues execution, as the operation is non-blocking.\nThis means that the network device will handle the actual data transfer in the background.\nIf the communication partner is not yet ready for the data transfer, however, the current process sends a control message indicating its readiness to the other process.\nThis control message is also sent via \\ac{RMA} to the agreed-upon location.\nThis has the advantage that the receiver does not need to interrupt when the control message arrives, as there is no need to handle it right away.\nInstead, the data transfer is initialized, once a process is ready to do so.\nThis is a clear distinction to other rendezvous protocols, where the receiver needs to handle a control message at some point in order to perform message matching. \nWhen a process initiates the actual data transfer, the transmission of the \"data arrived\"-flag is also scheduled with the network device, so that no further intervention by the processes is necessary, the processes only need to wait for the transfer to be handled by the network device in the background.\n\n\\citeauthor{zambre2019breaking} \\cite{zambre2019breaking} previously found out that more than 90\\% of the time spent in an \\texttt{MPI\\_{}Isend} is spend in the \\ac{MPI} layer, while only 10\\% of the time spent in lower layers that actually communicate with the network device, such as \\ac{UCX}.\n% Exact numbersfrom study: 91.76 in \\ac{MPI} 8.25 in UCP\nTherefore, this two-sided rendezvous protocol is designed to minimize the time spend in the \\ac{MPI} layer: Only one check for a memory location is performed, before initiating a data-transfer with the network device and returning the control flow from the non-blocking operation.\nBasically, all the other steps required, including the message matching, only need to be performed at the first occurrence of the communication, when it is established which persistent send operation matches with which persistent receive counterpart.\n\nThis \"two-sided\" protocol has one downside, however: There exists the possibility of crosstalk, where both processes signal the other that they are ready for the actual data transfer and in turn expect the other process to proceed with the actual data transfer.\\\\\nIn our experiments, this crosstalk happens very rarely, as the processes naturally \"order\" themselves to always have a slight interleaving. \n\\cite{afzal2020desynchronization}'s studies reveals that this natural tendency to produce an interleaving happens regularly \\cite{afzal2020desynchronization}. \nThis can be modeled to be able to predict the behavior of the \"noise\" that creates an interleaving of the different processes \\cite{afzal2021analytic}.\nIn our case, this means that the occurrence of crosstalk is rather unlikely.\nNevertheless, both communication partners can detect the occurrence of crosstalk with our protocol.\nIn this case, the receiving process will proceed with initiating the actual data transfer.\nThe details are described in \\cref{sec:paper:compmatch}.\n\nThis two-sided rendezevouz protocol tries to minimize the time spend inside of the send/receive operation.\nIt does not optimize the actual data-transfer that happens in the background and can be overlapped with computation.\nThe goal is to reduce the overhead that can \\emph{not} be overlapped with computation, thus increasing the computation-communication overlap.\nIn order to specifically measure the computation-communication overlap of different \\ac{MPI} implementations, \\citeauthor{medvedev2022imb} developed the IMB-ASYNC benchmark as a variant of \\acr{IMB} \\ac{MPI} benchmarks \\cite{medvedev2022imb}.\nWhen using the IMB-ASYNC benchmark, the two-sided protocol achieves a up to 90\\% better computation communication overlap for larger message sizes (1MB), compared to the default \\ac{UCX} implementation in OpenMPI.\nThe details of this evaluation are presented in \\cref{sec:paper:compmatch}\n\n\\subsection{Compiler Analysis of MPI Matching}\n\\label{sec:compmatch}\nThe optimized protocol described in \\cref{sec:optimization-porential} assumes that one persistent send operation has exactly one persistent receive operation.\n%TODO CB: warum ist a-priori wichtig?\n% um von anderer arbeit abzugrenzen\nIn this section, we explain hot to use a priori compiler analysis, in order to check that the given application adheres to this restriction.\n\nEstablishing which send operation matches with with receive operation at compiler time is challenging, however.\nThe compiler usually lacks important information, such as the target process of a message, as the number of processes present at execution time is unknown at compile-time.\nWe can, however, address this challenge by performing a separate compiler analysis for the sender and receiver side.\nThe information gathered at the sender and receiver side can than be combined at runtime. \n\nThe compiler analysis establishes the possibility of a \"matching conflict\" at the sender side.\nThis means that the compiler finds out if there are two different send operations that could send a message to the same destination with the same message envelope.\nIf this is the case, a matching conflict\" is detected, as those two operations may be matched by the same operation on the receiver side.\nIn this case, proper message matching procedures have to be followed, and the exact matching depends on the order of messages (also refer \\cref{sec:allow-overtaking}).\n\nThe analysis for the receiver side is analogous.\nThe compiler determines if any incoming message matching the analyzed receive operation could be matched by a different receive operation as well.\n\nThis combination of the information for the sender and receiver side happens at run-time, when two persistent operations match for the first time.\nIf we can establish that no other operation can send a matching message, and no other receive operation can match the message in question, the two operations in question match, and only those two operations match, meaning they will match again if the persistent operation is executed repeatedly.\nIn this case, an optimized protocol without further tag matching can be used, as explained in \\cref{sec:optimization-porential}.\n\nIn order to perform this analysis, the compiler does not necessarily need to know the full message envelope.\nFor this analysis to be successful, the compiler only needs to prove that the used message envelopes differ somehow, regardless of the exact value of e.g. the message tag used.\nA static analysis is usually able to tell that \\texttt{X} and \\texttt{X+1} will result in different values, regardless of the value of \\texttt{X}.\nThe full details of this compiler analysis are described in \\cref{sec:paper:compmatch}.\nThe current implementation of the static analysis is limited to the scope of one function, meaning that all considered \\ac{MPI} calls must be in the same function.\nWe will discuss how to mitigate this limitation and be able to also cover complex C++ programs using a precomputation approach in \\cref{sec:precompute}.\n\n\n\n\\section{Precomputation of message envelopes}\n\\label{sec:precompute}\nThe limitations of the static analysis explained above in \\cref{sec:compmatch} can be overcome by using a precomputation approach.\nThe basic idea is that at the initialization of \\ac{MPI} at the beginning of the application, all \\ac{MPI} message envelopes are computed before they are actually used.\nThis means that all the envelopes are already known to \\ac{MPI}, before communication begins.\nIn our case, we will use this information to remove tag matching for persistent \\ac{MPI} operations as described in \\cref{sec:optimization-porential}, but other usages to enhance the \\ac{MPI} performance might be possible as well, such as checking if any matching wildcards are used.\nThis idea is outlined in \\cref{fig:precompute-execution}.\nAlthough this approach, in general, is runtime-based, the compiler also plays a crucial role, as we use it to automatically perform this precomputation step without the need for further interference by the application developer.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=0.83\\linewidth,trim=0.9cm 13cm 3.0cm

pass. First (1) \\ac{MPI} is initialized as usual. Then (2) the precomputation phase starts, where all message envelopes are computed and registered to the backend library. After the precomputation phase, the original global state is restored (3), before normal execution resumes (4).}\n\t\\label{fig:precompute-execution}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Analysis of instructions necessary for precomputation}\n\\label{sec:precompute:anaysis}\nFor the compiler to automatically insert the operations necessary for precomputation, as illustrated in \\cref{fig:precompute-analysis} the instructions necessary to compute the used message envelopes need to be identified.\nThis is done using the idea of a taint analysis.\nThe values necessary for the message envelopes, namely the tag and source/destination rank are tainted.\nThen the compiler recursively taints all values necessary to compute the tainted values.\nAn example is shown in \\cref{lst:precompute-example}, where all statements necessary to precompute are highlighted, starting form the envelopes defined in lines 6 and 7.\nNote that the loop  in line 15-17 of \\cref{lst:precompute-example} is not highlighted, as it is not necessary for computing the message envelopes used.\nThe core idea of this approach is that the actual computation of the application is, like in the given example, not necessary to precompute the message envelopes.\nThis fits nicely with the design of persistent operations, as they are initialized only once and subsequently used multiple times.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=0.83\\linewidth,trim=0.9cm 7.8cm 3.0cm 3.7cm,clip]{media/04-compiler-opt/analysis.pdf}\n\t\\caption[Illustration of the precompute analysis process]{Illustration of the analysis process. Starting from the LLVM \\ac{IR} (1), first the message envelopes that should be precomputed are detected (2). Then, all instructions necessary for calculation and control flow are marked (3) and their side effects analyzed (4). The pass then generates the part of the program necessary for precomputation (5) and adds the handling of side effects (6). Finally (7), a call to the precompute phase is injected into \\texttt{main}, before the usual LLVM \\ac{LTO} optimizations pipeline is run (8) in order to produce a binary.}\n\t\\label{fig:precompute-analysis}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\t\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{media/04-compiler-opt/listing1.pdf}\n\t%\\vspace{-0.5cm}\n\t\\captionof{lstlisting}{Example code with statements ``necessary to precompute\"{} highlighted.}\n\t\\label{lst:precompute-example}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe details of analyzing the instructions necessary for message envelope precomputation across several functions are described in \\cref{sec:paper:precompute}, the general idea being that a similar recursive analysis is performed, such that all relevant functions are included as well as all functions calling those.\\\\\nHere, we would like to illustrate the particularly challenging issue of handling complex C++ constructs, in particular polymorphic inheritance and exceptions.\nTemplates are also supported by our approach, but as we implemented our analysis on the LLVM \\ac{IR} level, all templates already have been instantiated by the clang front-end at that point.\n\n\\paragraph{Polymorphic Inheritance:}\nPolymorphic inheritance is difficult to analyze with static analysis, as it results in indirect calls using a function pointer from an objects virtual table, in order to assure that the correct implementation of a virtual function is called.\n\nLLVM offers a whole program devirtualization pass that replaces indirect calls to virtual functions with direct ones, if this is applicable, mainly as a performance optimization to save the lookup for the function pointer in the objects virtual table.\nWe utilized the analysis part of this pass to find the possible call targets of an indirect call, even if it cannot outright be de-virtualized.\nIn this case, the call is necessary for envelope precomputation, if at least one possible call target is tainted accordingly. \nThe exact details on when a function is necessary for envelope precomputation are described in \\cref{sec:paper:precompute}.\n\n\\paragraph{Exceptions:}\nApart from function-calls, exceptions may also alter the control-flow.\nAs illustrated in the example of \\cref{lst:precompute-exception}, the used message envelopes may depend on the execution of the exception handling code.\nIf such cases are detected in our analysis, the recursive taint analysis therefore also taints the instructions needed to throw the exception.\nIn the example of \\cref{lst:precompute-exception}, this is the call to \\texttt{Read\\_{}Input\\_{}File()}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\t\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{media/04-compiler-opt/listing2.pdf}\n\t%\\vspace{-0.5cm}\n\t\\captionof{lstlisting}{Sketch of exception that is ``necessary to precompute\"{}.}\n\t\\label{lst:precompute-exception}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn most cases however, exceptions like \"out of memory\" lead to a program abort and are not handled by the application.\nAs C++ semantics require that certain destructors are called in the case of such exceptions, the compiler may automatically add some exception handling code, even if this is not done by the programmer explicitly.\nThose exceptions are ignored by the precomputation approach: if they occur during the precompute phase, the program will crash.\nHowever, a crash of the program that occurs in the precomputation phase is basically the same program behavior as crash during the \"real\" execution of a program.\nIn some circumstances, ignoring of exceptions during the precompute phase may alter the program's behavior, for example, when an exception is caught by the application programmer, in order to print a message before aborting.\nWe consider those alternations of the programs behavior similar to the removal of assertions in release codes.\nThis is discussed in detail in \\cref{sec:paper:precompute}, but it is not inherent to the precomputation approach in general, as it is possible to also include those exceptions in the precompute phase.\n%This is not done in the current implementation for performance optimization, again similar to assertions being removed from fully optimized release code.\n\n\n\\subsection{Side effects in the precompute phase}\n\\label{sec:precompute:insertion}\nSome of the operations necessary for envelope precomputation may exhibit side effects that need to be handled in order to ensure that the program can properly continue after the precompute phase.\n\n\nSide effects that result in an interaction with the execution environment are mostly the result of reading from the execution environment.\nFor example, reading the number of \\ac{MPI} processes.\nThese read operations, however, do not have harmful side effects that need to be handled, in the sense that it is possible to execute these operations again, in order to read the required values during the \"real\" execution of the program.\nTherefore, those read-only operations do not need to be handled specially.\nWriting to the execution environment is not allowed during the precompute phase, as it would alter the programs behaviour.\nWrite operations to the execution environment, however, are \"naturally\" excluded, as there is no reason to taint them during the analysis step, as they are not necessary for envelope precomputation.\n\nWrite operations to pointers, like global variables, however are necessary for precomputation.\nIf a pointer load is tainted in the analysis, the operations necessary to compute the result are all relevant store operations to the pointer. Therefore, those store operations are also tainted in the analysis step.\nThe details of this pointer analysis are presented in \\cref{sec:paper:precompute}.\nThis does mean, however, that global variables may have been overwritten during the precompute phase.\nThis is handled after the precompute phase by re-initializing all affected global variables to their initial state.\n\n\\subsection{Applicability of automatic Precomputation}\n\\label{sec:precompute:eval}\nWe tested our automatic precomputation approach with a complex C++ application (42.000 lines of code), that utilizes complex C++ features like polymorphic inheritance, templates and exceptions.\nThe compiler-based approach is able to handle such complex applications.\nWe chose the application,such that the optimizations presented in \\cref{sec:optimization-porential} are applicable, as a persistent send operation is matched by exactly one persistent receive counterpart in the application.\nThe precomputation phase is able to correctly determine that this is the case for the application and subsequently, the optimized communication scheme explained in \\cref{sec:optimization-porential} is utilized.\nWe were able to observe up to $15\\%$ of speedup for the application.\nThe performance benefit to be obtained may depend on the amount of communication that is part of the application.\nAs the precomputation itself happens at runtime, it does require a small initial runtime overhead.\nIn our experiments, this overhead is rather limited, however: Only $<0.3\\%$ of the performance gain is lost to the initial precompute overhead.\nTherefore, the precompute overhead is well worth it, even if less overall performance benefit can be observed.\n\n"

Lehrbuch?\nIf e.g. a \\texttt{readonly} function is called, the compiler then knows that no memory was changed by the function and re-reading variables from memory is not necessary.\n\n\nUsually, the compiler automatically derives the relevant attributes from the function body during the inter-procedural optimization step.\nThe main limitation of this is, that those attributes are not propagated to other compilation units.\nThis means that if a function from another compilation unit - such as the \\ac{MPI} library - is used, no optimizations at the call-site are possible.\nOne way to mitigate this problem is the usage of \\ac{LTO} \\cite{johnson2017thinlto}, where inter-procedural optimizations are performed at the linking stage of the compilation process, where the entire program is available for analysis.\nAs the \\ac{MPI} library is usually linked as a dynamically loaded library, however, \\ac{LTO} is not applicable.\n\nAs \\citeauthor{HTO} point out, more than half of the speedup achieved by using \\ac{LTO} can already be obtained by supplying the compiler with proper function attributes~\\cite{HTO}.\nThis means that these function attributes are an integral part of inter-procedural optimization.\n\nAnother approach to use compiler attributes across several translation units besides \\ac{LTO} was proposed by \\citeauthor{HTO}. The proposed \"{}Header Time Optimization\"{} propagates the attributes inferred by the compiler to other translation units via annotations in the header file \\cite{HTO}.\nIn our work, however, we do not use the compiler to infer the relevant function attributes, rather we infer them manually based on the \\ac{MPI} standard's semantics.\n\n\n\\subsection{Compiler Attributes applicable to MPI Functions}\nWe implemented an LLVM compiler pass that annotates the used \\ac{MPI} functions with their appropriate attributes.\nWe only utilize attributes that are already well established in LLVM.\nThis means that our approach does not add any significant tool-chain complexity to the compilation process.\nAll optimizations that are enabled by the addition of the compiler attributes are therefore already part of the LLVM infrastructure and usually being utilized inside of one compilation unit or at \\ac{LTO}.\n\nWe manually derived applicable compiler attributes from the semantics prescribed by there \\ac{MPI} standard.\nThis means that our approach is compatible with all standard-compliant implementations.\nAs these attributes only target the call-sites and not the \\ac{MPI} library itself, our approach is also oblivious to the compiler with with the \\ac{MPI} library itself was built.\n\n\\paragraph{For a blocking point-to-point operation,} the following attributes are appropriate:\n\n\\mintinline{llvm}{nofree memory(argmem: readwrite, inaccessiblemem: readwrite)}\\\\\n\\mintinline{llvm}{@MPI_Send(ptr nocapture readonly %buf, %count, %dtype, %dest,}\\\\ \\mintinline{llvm}{%tag, %comm)}\n\t\n\tAccording to the \\ac{MPI} standard, the used send buffer is read-only, which is expressed by the \\texttt{readonly} attribute.\n\tThe pointer to the sendbuffer is not used after the call returns.\n\tThis allows the specification of the \\texttt{nocapture} attribute.\n\t\\texttt{nocapture} means that the pointer is not stored for later usage.\t\n\tOther literature uses the term pointer \\emph{escape} for this~\\cite{choi1999escape}.\n\tWhen \\texttt{nocapture} is specified, the compiler can be sure, that no other thread or function is going to access the relevant pointer after the send returns, wich allows for elemination of unnecessary memory accesses.\t\n\tThis attribute may not be inferred by the compiler alone.\n\tFor the compiler to be able to infer \\texttt{nocapture}, it needs to \\textit{prove} that nothing captures the pointer.\n\tAs the network might be involved in the communication, the compiler may not be able to prove that all lower network layers do not capture the pointer. \n\t\\\\\n\tSince the call to \\texttt{MPI\\_Send} does not free any memory accessible to the caller, we can annotate the whole function with \\texttt{nofree} as well.\n\t\\\\\n\t\\\\\n\tThe \\mintinline{llvm}{memory(argmem: readwrite, inaccessiblemem: readwrite)} attribute, signals that all memory accesses of the send operation happen either via the pointers provided as arguments or to memory that is inaccessible to the caller.\n\tStrictly speaking, this is not a valid attribute for this function, or most other \\ac{MPI} functions for that matter.\n\tThe reason is that it is possible to provide the \\ac{MPI} implementation with an additional user-allocated buffer which can then be used by the \\ac{MPI} library (buffered-mode).\n\tThis buffer is potentially accessible from the user's program, which would require to use the attribute that \\emph{all} memory is \\texttt{readwrite}.\n\tHowever, usage of a buffer supplied to the \\ac{MPI} library is undefined behavior according to the \\ac{MPI} standard's semantics.\n\tTherefore, for any compliant \\ac{MPI} application the user-provided buffer is effectively inaccessible to the user.\n\tThis allows usage of the more restrictive memory attribute, potentially enabling more optimizations.\n\tReceive Operations are annotated similarly, with \\texttt{writeonly} being used instead of \\texttt{readonly} for the buffer argument.\n\n\t\n\t\\paragraph{Non-blocking point-to-point operations} share the same attributes as blocking ones:\\\\\n\t\\mintinline[]{llvm}{nofree memory(argmem: readwrite, inaccessiblemem: readwrite)}\\\\\n\t\\mintinline[]{llvm}{@MPI_Isend(ptr nocapture readonly %buf, %count, %dtype,}\\\\\n\t\t\\mintinline[]{llvm}{%dest, %tag, %comm, ptr nocapture writeonly %request)}\\\\    \n\t\t\tHere, the use of \\texttt{nocapture} might look incorrect at first glance.\n\t\t\tStrictly speaking, the \\ac{MPI} library may capture the pointer to the send-buffer.\n\t\t\tBut - similar to the above reasoning - the send-buffer pointer is \"{}out of the user-application context\"{} while the non-blocking operation is in progress, as any write usage results in undefined behavior according to the \\ac{MPI} standard's semantics.\n\t\t\tA standard compliant user application will not harmfully access the message buffer before it ensures completion with another \\ac{MPI} call.\n\\\\\n\\\\\nOur pass also attributes other commonly used \\ac{MPI} functions such as \\texttt{MPI\\_{}Comm\\_{}rank} with similar attributes. Those attributes are described in \\cref{sec:paper:mpi-fnattrs} in detail.\n\n\\subsection{Optimization potential}\nWith the usage of appropriate compiler attributes, additional compiler optimizations are triggered, as the compiler has more information on the semantics of \\ac{MPI} functions.\nWe can observe that the assembly code generated is further optimized with the use of assertions for most of the exascale proxy applications \\cite{ESP}.\n%TODO schriftgr\u00f6\u00dfe in listing!\n\\begin{figure}[!tb]\n\\begin{minipage}{0.53\\textwidth}\n\\begin{minted}[linenos]{nasm}\nmov     rsi, rsp\nmov     rdi, rbx\ncall    MPI_Comm_size@PLT\nlea     rsi, [rsp + 4]\nmov     rdi, rbx\ncall    MPI_Comm_rank@PLT\n; ... \n; Loads the value of size:\nmov     eax, dword ptr [rsp]      \nadd     eax, 10\n; ...\n; Loads the value of rank:\nmov     edx, dword ptr [rsp + 4]  \nlea     rcx, [rsp + 20]\n\n\ncall    ;Mangled function name\n; rank is reloaded:\nmov     esi, dword ptr [rsp + 4]  \nmov     eax, dword ptr [rsp + 40]\nor      eax, esi\n; ... \n; size reloaded from memory:\nmov     esi, dword ptr [rsp]      \n\\end{minted}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\begin{minipage}[linenos]{0.46\\textwidth}\n\\begin{minted}{nasm}\nlea     rsi, [rsp + 76]\nmov     rdi, rbx\ncall    MPI_Comm_size@PLT\nlea     rsi, [rsp + 72]\nmov     rdi, rbx\ncall    MPI_Comm_rank@PLT\n; ... \n; Uses separate register to load size:\nmovsxd  rbx, dword ptr [rsp + 76]\nlea     eax, [rbx + 10]\n; ... \n; Uses separate register to load rank:\nmov     ebp, dword ptr [rsp + 72] \nlea     rcx, [rsp + 12]\n; move between registers needed:\nmov     edx, ebp                  \ncall    ;Mangled function name\n\n; Reuse of the loaded rank\nmov     eax, dword ptr [rsp + 32]\nor      eax, ebp                  \n; ... \n; Reuse of the loaded size\nmov     esi, ebx                  \n\\end{minted}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\captionof{lstlisting}[Comparison of assembly with and without \\ac{MPI} function attributes]{Comparison of assembly code generated from \\texttt{lulesh.cc} with and without attributes.

For instance, deprecating \"Post-Start-Complete-Wait synchronization\" in \\ac{RMA} operations is currently under discussion \\cite{mpiforumdeprecate}. The \\ac{MPI} forum opted for the least invasive approach when adding new communicator info assertions (see \\cref{sec:assertions}), ensuring backward compatibility without requiring changes to existing applications. This means users must \"opt-in\" to an optimized implementation when applicable. Alternatively, the \\ac{MPI} standard could mandate that certain assertions \\emph{must} be specified, forcing users to consider new, potentially optimized approaches. Since this thesis demonstrates that the compiler can detect these assertions (see \\cref{sec:assertions}), users could rely on the compiler for code modernization, minimizing the need for manual changes. However, such a design may be inflexible for future updates, as it could hinder the introduction of new assertions that the compiler cannot analyze."

              "We discussed the current usage pattern of \\ac{MPI} in \\cref{sec:mpi-usage}.\nWe see that modern \\ac{MPI} features, such as one-sided, persistent or partitioned operations are not yet widely adopted.\nThis thesis' contributions to facilitate the adoption of modern \\ac{MPI} features are illustrated in \\cref{fig:cycle-good-summary}.\n\nIn order to ease the development of correct \\ac{MPI} programs, \\ac{MPI} correctness checking tools have been developed.\nIn order to improve those tools' real world applicability, this thesis introduced correctness benchmark suites, most notably \\acl{MBB}, in \\cref{sec:correct}.\nThese benchmarks show that the state-of-the-art correctness checking tools are suited for many \\ac{MPI} usage patterns, but still have room for improvement.\nThe unit-test like design of \\ac{MBB} is well suited to directly point out the specific cases in which the tool should be improved, in order to focus development of better tools.\n\nIn order to ease the incorporation of modern \\ac{MPI} features, this thesis explores compiler based techniques in \\cref{sec:modernization}.\nSuch compiler-based approaches can modernize some usage patterns without the need for user interference.\nWe showed that such a compiler based approach is also suitable for Hybrid \\ac{MPI}+OpenMP applications, to facilitate the usage of partitioned \\ac{MPI} operations, that are explicitly designed for use in a multi-threaded environment.\nAn automatic modernization allows for easy incorporation of modern \\ac{MPI} into legacy codes.\nCurrently, this results in the same performance, as the implementations for the modern features are not yet optimized.\n\nIn terms of the performance benefit of using modern \\ac{MPI} features, \\cref{sec:general-optimization} shows, how compiler knowledge can be utilized, in order to achieve a better performance.\nWe developed an approach to precompute all message envelops at the initialization of \\ac{MPI}, in order to save message matching overhead.\nWe demonstrated the feasibility of this approach with a medium-sized complex C++ example application ($\\approx140.000$ lines of code), and showed a better runtime performance as a result.\n\n\\section{Incentives for Adoption}\nThis thesis suggests that \\ac{MPI} library vendors could gain a competitive advantage by adopting a compiler-based approach, allowing users to benefit from optimized implementations of modern \\ac{MPI} operations without the need for significant code modifications.\nMajor \\ac{MPI} vendors are better positioned to demonstrate the advantages of modern features than academic research.\nThe in-depth understanding of \\ac{MPI} usage patterns presented in \\cref{sec:mpi-usage} can help to weigh the costs and benefits of such a strategy, which is ultimately a business decision. \nOur study utilized a set of general applications, but we prepared the analysis process, such that a different set of codes can be analyzed.\nThis enables a vendor to quickly understand benchmark sets that represent their client's usage patterns, in order to better understand to what extent they would benefit from optimized implementations of modern \\ac{MPI} features.\n\n\nAnother way to encourage the usage of Modern \\ac{MPI} features could be the deprecation of older \\ac{MPI} operations in the \\ac{MPI} standard.\nFor example, this is currently discussed for the ``Post-Start-Complete-Wait synchronization\"{} of \\ac{RMA} operations \\cite{mpiforumdeprecate}.\nThe \\ac{MPI} forum opted for the least invasive approach when adding new communicator info assertions (see \\cref{sec:assertions}), ensuring backward compatibility without requiring changes to existing applications.\nThis means users must ``opt-in\" to an optimized implementation, when this is applicable to their code.\nAlternatively, the \\ac{MPI} standard could mandate that certain assertions \\emph{must} be specified, forcing users to consider new, potentially optimized approaches.\nFor example, the standard could mandate, that the information whether  or not matching wildcards are utilized \\emph{must} be given.\nAs this thesis demonstrates that the compiler is able to detect such assertions (see \\cref{sec:assertions}), users could rely on the compiler to perform the mandated code modernization, thus minimizing the need for manual changes.\nHowever, such a design may be inflexible for future changes, as it hinders the introduction of new assertions in the future, if those assertions cannot be analyzed by the compiler.\n\n\\section{Future Research Directions}\nIn the future, it will be important to assess how the approaches presented in this thesis can be adopted for upcoming versions of \\ac{MPI}.\nMonitoring changes in \\ac{MPI} usage patterns over time will be of particular interest.\nThe in-depth analysis of \\ac{MPI} usage patterns presented in \\cref{sec:mpi-usage} is already prepared for this, as the analysis runs automatically in a continuous integration pipeline.\n\n\nThis thesis shows that compiler based modernization approaches can be applied to concepts entirely new to MPI, such as communicator info assertions (see \\cref{sec:assertions}).\nAdditionally, other concepts in MPI exist, without widespread usage, such as the newly introduced \\ac{MPI} session model.\nTherefore, we want to explore how the approaches presented in this thesis can be transferred to such concepts, in order to facilitate the incorporation of malleability and fault-tolerance aspects to MPI applications.\n\n\nWe show in \\cref{sec:partitioning} that a compiler based approach can be utilized to modernize hybrid codes, with the example of partitioned operations in \\ac{MPI}+\\ac{OpenMP} codes.\nIn the future, it will be interesting to research to what extend a further coupling of \\ac{MPI}+\\ac{OpenMP} can be benefited by such compiler based approaches.\nCurrently, for example, the MPI forum discusses the idea of \\ac{MPI} continuations \\cite{Schuchart2021,protze2020mpi} to more seamlessly integrate task based programming models, such as \\ac{OpenMP} tasking.\nBesides a better integration with \\ac{OpenMP}, the seamless integration of other programming models, such as CUDA or SYCL for accelerators, may also benefit from researching such compiler based approaches.\n\n\nAnother avenue for future research is applying compiler-based modernization approaches to other programming models, such as \\ac{OpenMP}.\nAlthough \\ac{OpenMP} already relies heavily on the compiler through the use of pragma directives, it faces a similar issue to \\ac{MPI} regarding the adoption of newer features.\nOur study shows that most applications only use the standard \\texttt{pragma omp parallel for} directive, leading to many inefficient parallel regions where the overhead of thread creation and management likely outweighs the benefits of parallelization \\cite{openmp-study}.\nCompiler-based approaches could be useful in this context, for example, by consolidating several parallel regions.\n\n%A compiler based approach could also be utilized to transform a program from OpenMP to MPI \\cite{squar2020cato}\n\nTODO: final sentences about new languages and programming paradigms\ngive me several suggestions for a final sentence"

This thesis  includes an in depth assessment of current MPI usage practice.\nOne reason, why the modern MPI features do not see widespread adoption yet may be their complexity.\nOn the other hand, there are currently no relevant MPI implementations, that provide a highly optimized implementation for those modern features. This in turn lowers the likelihood of user adopting those modern features.\nBut as many users rely on the \"old\" MPI features, the implementation developers have incentive to prioritize highly optimized implementations for the old features.\nThis may impair the development of highly optimized implementations for the modern MPI features, as only a very limited amount of users are utilizing them, creating a cycle of \"non-improvement\".\n\t\nThis thesis explores different ways to \"break out\" of this \"non-improvement\" cycle by\na) facilitating correctness checking tool support,\nb) compiler based Automatic modernization of MPI codes and\nc) exploiting compiler knowledge to further optimize the implementation of modern MPI features.\n\t\n\nMPI correcntess tools are helpful for developing of correct MPI applications.\nThis is especially relevant in the context of MPI, as the relatively low level API of MPI may be error prone in addition to the inherent complexity of deveoping parallel applications.\nThis thesis presents a structured evaluation of te tools real world applicability.\nThe introduction of the Correctness Benchmark suite MPI-BugBench facilitates the development of improved correctness checking tools.\n\t\nIn order to facilitate an early adoption of new modern MPI features, compiler based approaches can be utilized.\nA compiler based approach that does not require any interaction from the user, has the advantage that it can automatically enable the usage of modern MPI operation, with minimal effort required by the application programmer.\nThis thesis demonstrated, that such a compiler-based approach is applicable to some features of the most recent MPI 4.0 standard.\n\t\nThe compiler can additionally also be utilized, in order to further optimize the performance of MPI.\nThis thesis shows that compiler based optimizations can be utilized, to enhance the performance of - currently underused - persistent MPI operations."

              "### Shortened Abstract:\n\nMPI has become the standard for distributed memory computing since its inception in 1994. While the standard has evolved to include new technologies like RDMA, many applications still rely on the original set of MPI operations. This thesis investigates the current usage of MPI, noting that modern features are underutilized due to their complexity and the lack of highly optimized implementations. The continued focus on optimizing older features perpetuates a cycle of neglect for newer ones.\n\nTo break this cycle, the thesis explores three approaches: \n1. Enhancing correctness checking tools.\n2. Automatically modernizing MPI codes through compilers.\n3. Using compiler optimizations to improve the performance of modern MPI features.\n\nCorrectness tools, such as the newly introduced MPI-BugBench, help ensure reliable MPI applications, particularly given MPI's complexity. Compiler-based methods can encourage early adoption of new MPI features with minimal programmer effort and optimize performance for underused operations, including those from the MPI 4.0 standard."

              "To create a helpful error message, we propose including the source code line of at least one involved MPI function. This allows developers to quickly identify where in the code they need to investigate to understand and resolve the issue. For standardized benchmarks, this information provides clarity and precision. Ambiguities may arise if certain MPI calls are missing; however, since no MPI call exists in isolation, a correctness tool should identify the corresponding MPI call that causes the error. For instance, if a non-blocking operation is missing a \\texttt{MPI\\_Wait}\\footnote{or other means of completing the non-blocking request}, the precise location of the missing \\texttt{MPI\\_Wait} is unclear, but the location of the initiating non-blocking operation is well-defined."

              "The `minted` package in LaTeX is a popular choice for syntax highlighting, but it requires `Pygments` and shell escape enabled, which might not be allowed by some publishers like Springer due to security reasons. Here are a few alternatives to use syntax highlighting without `minted`:\n\n### 1. Use the `listings` Package\n\nThe `listings` package is a good alternative for syntax highlighting in LaTeX and does not require shell escape. Here\u2019s an example of how to use it:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{listings}\n\\usepackage{xcolor}\n\n\\lstset{\n    language=Python,  % or other programming language\n    basicstyle=\\ttfamily\\footnotesize,\n    keywordstyle=\\color{blue},\n    stringstyle=\\color{red},\n    commentstyle=\\color{green},\n    breaklines=true,\n    columns=fullflexible\n}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\begin{lstlisting}\ndef hello_world():\n    print(\"Hello, World!\")\n\\end{lstlisting}\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\n### 2. Use the `tcolorbox` Package with `listings`\n\nThe `tcolorbox` package can enhance the appearance of the listings.\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{listings}\n\\usepackage{xcolor}\n\\usepackage{tcolorbox}\n\n\\tcbuselibrary{listingsutf8}\n\n\\newtcblisting{pythoncode}[1][]{colback=white!95!black,\n    colframe=black,\n    listing only,\n    listing options={\n        language=Python,\n        basicstyle=\\ttfamily\\footnotesize,\n        keywordstyle=\\color{blue},\n        stringstyle=\\color{red},\n        commentstyle=\\color{green},\n        breaklines=true,\n        columns=fullflexible,\n        #1\n    },\n    left=0pt, right=0pt, top=0pt, bottom=0pt\n}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\begin{pythoncode}\ndef hello_world():\n    print(\"Hello, World!\")\n\\end{pythoncode}\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\n### 3. Use External Tools to Embed Code\n\nAnother approach is to use an external tool to create syntax-highlighted code snippets as images and then include these images in your LaTeX document. Tools like `Pygments`, `highlight.js`, or online code highlighters can generate these images.\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{graphicx}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{code_snippet.png}\n    \\caption{Code snippet}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\n### 4. Use Verbatim Environment\n\nFor a simple, no-frills approach, the `verbatim` environment can be used to include plain code without syntax highlighting.\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{verbatim}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\begin{verbatim}\ndef hello_world():\n    print(\"Hello, World!\")\n\\end{verbatim}\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nEach of these methods can be used to include code in your LaTeX document without the need for `minted`. Choose the one that best fits your needs and conforms to the requirements set by Springer or any other publisher."

              "Yes, you can output the `minted` render into a figure by capturing the output as an image. This can be done by running LaTeX with `minted` to generate the code rendering, then converting that output into an image format (such as PNG or PDF), and finally including this image in your main LaTeX document.\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step guide to achieve this:\n\n### Step 1: Create a LaTeX Document with `minted`\n\nFirst, create a LaTeX document that uses the `minted` package to render your code. Let\u2019s call this file `code.tex`.\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{standalone}\n\\usepackage{minted}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\begin{minted}[frame=lines,fontsize=\\scriptsize]{python}\ndef hello_world():\n    print(\"Hello, World!\")\n\\end{minted}\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Compile the Document to Generate an Image\n\nCompile `code.tex` to produce an output. You can use `pdflatex` with the `-shell-escape` option to enable `minted`.\n\n```sh\npdflatex -shell-escape code.tex\n```\n\nThis will generate a `code.pdf` file.\n\n### Step 3: Convert the PDF to an Image\n\nUse a tool like `convert` (from ImageMagick) or `pdftoppm` (from Poppler) to convert the `code.pdf` file into an image format, such as PNG.\n\nUsing `convert`:\n\n```sh\nconvert -density 300 code.pdf -quality 90 code.png\n```\n\nUsing `pdftoppm`:\n\n```sh\npdftoppm -png code.pdf code\n```\n\n### Step 4: Include the Image in Your Main LaTeX Document\n\nNow that you have the image (e.g., `code.png`), you can include it in your main LaTeX document. Here\u2019s an example of how to do this:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{graphicx}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{code.png}\n    \\caption{Highlighted code using minted}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\n### Automating the Process\n\nIf you want to automate this process, you can write a shell script that performs all the steps from compiling the `minted` LaTeX document to converting the PDF to an image.\n\nHere\u2019s a sample script:\n\n```sh\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Step 1: Compile the LaTeX file with minted\npdflatex -shell-escape code.tex\n\n# Step 2: Convert the PDF to an image\nconvert -density 300 code.pdf -quality 90 code.png\n\necho \"Image created: code.png\"\n```\n\nMake sure to give the script execute permissions:\n\n```sh\nchmod +x generate_code_image.sh\n```\n\nThen run the script:\n\n```sh\n./generate_code_image.sh\n```\n\nThis process allows you to use `minted` for syntax highlighting while avoiding issues with shell escape restrictions by converting the output into an image."

              "The error you are encountering often suggests that there might be an issue with the `minted` package usage or a specific command in your LaTeX code. Let's ensure that the minimal working example is correct and does not have issues with command characters.\n\nHere's a streamlined step-by-step guide to properly set up and convert `minted` output to an image, including troubleshooting any potential issues:\n\n### Step 1: Create a LaTeX Document with `minted`\n\nEnsure you have a minimal LaTeX document (`code.tex`) that uses the `minted` package correctly:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{standalone}\n\\usepackage{minted}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\begin{minted}[frame=lines,fontsize=\\scriptsize]{python}\ndef hello_world():\n    print(\"Hello, World!\")\n\\end{minted}\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Compile the Document\n\nCompile `code.tex` using `pdflatex` with the `-shell-escape` option:\n\n```sh\npdflatex -shell-escape code.tex\n```\n\nEnsure that `pygmentize` is installed and available on your system, as `minted` relies on it. If you encounter errors, make sure `pygmentize` is installed by running:\n\n```sh\npip install Pygments\n```\n\n### Step 3: Convert the PDF to an Image\n\nAfter successfully generating `code.pdf`, convert it to an image using `pdftoppm` or `convert`:\n\nUsing `pdftoppm`:\n\n```sh\npdftoppm -png code.pdf code\n```\n\nThis will generate `code-1.png`.\n\nUsing `convert` (from ImageMagick):\n\n```sh\nconvert -density 300 code.pdf -quality 90 code.png\n```\n\n### Step 4: Include the Image in Your Main LaTeX Document\n\nCreate your main LaTeX document and include the generated image:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{graphicx}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{code-1.png}\n    \\caption{Highlighted code using minted}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\n### Automating the Process\n\nHere is a shell script that automates these steps:\n\n```sh\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Step 1: Compile the LaTeX file with minted\npdflatex -shell-escape code.tex\n\n# Step 2: Convert the PDF to an image\npdftoppm -png code.pdf code\n\necho \"Image created: code-1.png\"\n```\n\nEnsure the script has execute permissions:\n\n```sh\nchmod +x generate_code_image.sh\n```\n\nRun the script:\n\n```sh\n./generate_code_image.sh\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting Tips\n\n1. **Ensure `pygmentize` is Installed:**\n   Make sure `pygmentize` (from Pygments) is installed and accessible from the command line.\n\n2. **Check LaTeX Compilation:**\n   If you encounter LaTeX errors, ensure your LaTeX distribution is up to date and has all required packages installed (`minted`, `standalone`).\n\n3. **Verify Shell Escape:**\n   The `-shell-escape` option is necessary for `minted` to work. Ensure your LaTeX editor or environment allows this option.\n\n4. **Check for Errors:**\n   Look at the `.log` file generated by `pdflatex` for detailed error messages.\n\nBy following these steps and troubleshooting tips, you should be able to successfully generate a syntax-highlighted image of your code using `minted` and include it in your main LaTeX document."

              "Title: Enhancing MPI Application Performance Through Modern MPI Features\n\nAbstract:\nMany MPI applications primarily utilize a limited subset of MPI features, focusing on collective and point-to-point operations. Advanced MPI operations, such as one-sided, partitioned, and persistent operations, have yet to see widespread adoption. Research indicates that leveraging these modern features can significantly improve performance. However, current MPI implementations often lack highly optimized versions of these advanced features, as there is limited incentive to develop them given the predominant use of traditional operations.\n\nThis creates a cycle where the absence of optimized implementations discourages users from adopting new features. In this talk, I will address this issue by presenting strategies to encourage the adoption of modern MPI features. These strategies include compiler-based approaches and enhanced correctness checking tools. Additionally, I will demonstrate how leveraging compiler insights can further optimize the performance of these advanced MPI operations."

              "To expand upon the design of MPI-BugBench (MBB) and address the requested bullet points:\n\n### Test Code Generation:\n- MBB builds upon the test code generation concept pioneered by the MPI Bugs Initiative. This involves systematically creating test cases that isolate and expose specific MPI usage errors.\n- The integration of test cases from MPI-CorrBench enriches MBB's test suite, ensuring a broader coverage of potential MPI programming mistakes.\n\n### Generating Test Cases:\n- Test cases in MBB are generated to focus on individual MPI usage errors. Each test case is designed to exhibit only one specific error, allowing for precise identification and resolution.\n- The generation process likely involves scripting or automated procedures to systematically create test cases with controlled variations in MPI function usage, parameters, and context.\n\n### Adding New Errors:\n- MBB provides a structured framework for incorporating new errors into its test suite. Developers can contribute by following guidelines for creating test cases that target specific MPI usage mistakes.\n- Contributions might involve creating new test scripts or modifying existing ones to introduce novel MPI error scenarios.\n- Documentation or guidelines within MBB can detail the process for adding new errors, including instructions on test case format, error types, and integration into the overall test suite.\n\n### Coverage of Error Types:\n- MBB comprehensively covers various error types commonly encountered in MPI programming.\n- Error types include, but are not limited to, issues such as mismatched data types, improper buffer sizes, incorrect communicator usage, and synchronization errors.\n- The test suite is structured to systematically address each error type, ensuring thorough examination and validation of MPI application behavior under diverse error conditions.\n\nBy adhering to these design principles, MPI-BugBench establishes itself as a robust tool for identifying and rectifying MPI usage errors, thereby enhancing the reliability and performance of MPI applications."

              "I have this research paper:\n\\section{Attributing MPI Functions}\n\\label{sec:attributes}\n\nWe give the compiler more information on the pointer usages of MPI functions by using LLVM IR function and parameter Attributes.\nUsually, the compiler analyzes the function and infers the relevant attributes itself.\nBut this only works inside of one translation unit.\nAs the MPI library is usually dynamically linked at runtime, we manually need to specify the relevant annotations.\n\nAs the relevant attributes exist on on the LLVM IR level, we implemented an LLVM optimization pass, that annotates the definitions of the used MPI functions before all other optimizations happen.\nAs these attributes are already part of the LLVM infrastructure, the usage of these attributes in order to perform code optimizations is already part of LLVM.\n\n%TODO cite Study of Alex and me\nAs can be seen in studies on MPI usage \\cite{laguna2019}, most applications use only a small subset of the available MPI functions.\nTherefore, we limit our pass to such commonly used ones.\n\nCITE doerfert reference (presentation)\n\nWe use the following relevant attributes for the annotations:\n\n\\subsection{Function and Parameter Attributes}\n\\begin{description}\n    \\item[memory] This function attribute describes which memory locations are accessed in which way.\n        For our annotations we mostly use it as \\texttt{memory(argmem: readwrite, inaccessiblemem: readwrite)}.\n        This specifies, that in this way annotated functions only access memory based on pointers given as parameters, or memory that the calling context has no access to.\n        Any other memory locations that are accessible from the calling context are not used by a function with this attribute, like for example captured pointers or other local variables.\n        This allows for possible optimizations, as the compiler can be sure that variables that are not used during the call have the same value afterwards as they had before.\\footnote{Since LLVM 16 this attribute replaces the attributes \\texttt{argmemonly}, \\texttt{inaccessiblememonly} and \\texttt{inaccessiblemem\\_or\\_argmemonly}}\n    \\item[readnone] This parameter attribute specifies that a pointer argument is not dereferenced during the function call.\n        Possible optimizations include that variables do not have to be stored before and loaded afterwards, but can be kept in registers.\n    \\item[readonly] This parameter attribute specifies that a pointer argument is only dereferenced for reading the pointed to data.\n        Pointed to variables need to be written to memory before the call, but they can potentially be kept in registers and used from there after the call.\n    \\item[writeonly] This parameter attribute specifies that a pointer argument is only dereferenced for writing to the pointed to memory.\n        In rare cases this can omit stores to the memory region before function calls.\n    \\item[nocapture] This parameter attribute specifies that a pointer argument is not captured by the function call.\n        It allows for omitting memory accesses after the call, as there are no other threads or contexts that still access the annotated pointer.\n    \\item[nofree] This parameter attribute specifies that the memory pointed to by a pointer argument is not freed during the call, so that accesses to the memory locations are still valid afterwards.\n        An identically named function attribute extends this to all valid pointers in the calling context.\n\\end{description}\n\n\n\\subsection{Applying Attributes to MPI Functions}\n\\label{sec:mpi-funcs}\nIt is possible to try finding corresponding attributes for functions by letting the compiler infer them, which is the way these issue is handled by the compiler inside one translation unit.\nIn this work however, we infer fitting attributes manually by analyzing the semantic of MPI functions as described in the standard \\cite{mpi41}.\nThis approach allows for the annotation of additional attributes that the compiler may not be able to infer by itself.\nWe will show some examples of this later in this section.\nAdditionally, this strategy is not dependent on any particular MPI implementation, hence our pass is valid to be used with any standard compliant implementation.\nThe following provides examples of annotations for different MPI functions:\n\n\\begin{description}\n    \\item[MPI\\_Send] According to the MPI standard, the used send buffer is only read.\n        Therefore, we annotate it as a \\texttt{readonly} pointer.\n        As this is a blocking operation and since the pointer to the buffer is not used after the operation completes, this pointer can be annotated with \\texttt{nocapture} as well.\n        This attribute may not be inferred by the compiler alone.\n        For the compiler to be able to infer \\texttt{nocapture}, it needs to \\textit{prove} that nothing captures the pointer.\n        As the network might be involved in the communication, the compiler may not be able to prove that all lower network layers do not capture the pointer. \n        Since the call to \\texttt{MPI\\_Send} does not free any memory accessible to the caller, we can annotate the whole function with \\texttt{nofree} as well.\n        Additionally, we can annotate \\texttt{memory(argmem: readwrite, inaccessiblemem: readwrite)}.\\footnote{corresponds to the former \\texttt{inaccessiblemem\\_or\\_argmemonly} attribute}\n        This is, strictly speaking, not a valid attribute for this function, or most other MPI functions for that matter, since it is possible to provide the MPI implementation with an additional user-allocated buffer, that can then be used by the MPI library.\n        This buffer is potentially accessible from the user's program, which would require to use the attribute that \\emph{all} memory is \\texttt{readwrite}.\n        However, usage of a buffer supplied to the MPI library is undefined behavior according to the MPI standard's semantics. Therefore, no standard compliant MPI application does this and the user provided buffer is effectively inaccessible to the user.\n\t\tThis allows using the more restrictive memory attribute, that can potentially enable more optimizations.\n    \\item[MPI\\_Isend] Non-blocking operations have the same attributes as their blocking counterpart, although the use of \\texttt{nocapture} might look incorrect at first glance.\n    \tStrictly speaking the MPI library may capture the pointer to the send-buffer.\n    \tBut - similar to the above reasoning - the send-buffer pointer is \"{}out of the user-application context\"{} while the non-blocking operation is in progress, as any write usage can result in undefined behavior according to the MPI standard's semantics.\n    \tFor a send operation, read usages of the send-buffer are not harmful, but the semantics of MPI imply that the MPI library cannot write through the \"{}captured\"{} pointer. This means that assuming \\texttt{nocapture} is also correct in those cases.\n    \tTherefore, the compiler can treat non-blocking operation as \"{}finished after the non-blocking call returns\"{}, as a standard compliant user application will not harmfully access the message buffer before it ensures completion with another MPI call.    \t\n    \\item[MPI\\_Send\\_init] In the case of creating a persistent request, the message buffer is captured by the MPI library. In this case, the above reasoning does not apply, as the MPI library will use the captured buffer when the user instructs it to do so by using \\texttt{MPI\\_{}Start}\n    \\item[MPI\\_Start] As this function starts the actual communication of a persistent request, we cannot specify any restrictions on the memory access of this function.\n    The available attributes are not able to express any connections between the communication request and the accessed buffers, as the same method is used to start send and receive operations.\n    \\item[MPI\\_Allreduce] Collective operations have the same annotations as point to point calls.\n    Some collective operations can be specified to happen in-place by using \\texttt{MPI\\_IN\\_PLACE} as the receive buffer.\n    The compiler is able to detect the usage of this special MPI pointer value and could theoretically adjust the annotations, based on which pointers are read and which ones are written, by the given usage pattern.\n    This is not implemented in our pass yet, as it only supports annotations on a per-function level and it is possible to have some operations in place and others with separate send and receive buffers.\n    Therefore, our pass uses the most conservative annotations that match both in-place and out of place usages.\n\\end{description}\n\\section{Evaluation}\n\\label{sec:eval}\n\nTo evaluate the impact of the additional added attributes, we use our pass during the compilation process of a variety of MiniApps by the Exascale Proxy Applications Project\\footnote{Citation: \\url{https://proxyapps.exascaleproject.org/}}.\n%TODO proper citation\n\n\\subsection{Assembly-level differences}\n\nTo directly see the difference in the produced machine code, we compare the code generated without our pass with the code generated including our pass.\n%TODO machine setup genauer beschreiben\n% (Lichtenberg) OS and clang version numbers\nWe use the \\texttt{clang-17} compiler for the x86-64 architecture on a GNU Linux machine.\nTo be able to see additional optimizations we compile the programs using the respective default optimization flags, i.e. \\texttt{O2} or \\texttt{O3} depending on the program.\n\nMost differences in the generated x86 assembly are the results of the compiler changing the used registers and memory addresses of variables.\nEven though these differences might also affect the performance of programs, we trust that the compiler does reasonable decisions for these changes.\nTherefore, we limit our observations to changes regarding the number of generated instructions and the resulting control flow, as we can also observe significant changes there.\n\nSince the added attributes all concern the memory behavior of the annotated MPI functions, most observable differences are in relation to that.\n%TODO proper citation\n\n\nWe showcase a selection of the observable changes to the assembly by using the examples of LULESH CITATION and SimpleMOC CITATION, while we are able to find similar changes in other programs as well.\n\n\\subsubsection{Example: LULESH}\n\n%The used code examples are excerpts that have been shortened to improve readability.\n%Changes in the regions not shown are not part of our analysis.\n\n% lulesh.s: ca. line 1220: reload omitted because of nocapture\n%           ca. line 1245: move instead of reload, nocapture as above\n%           ca. line 1260: move instead of reload, same as above\n%           ca. line 1310: moves instead of reloads, same as above\n%           ca. line 1515: logical or is done faster because no reload necessary, same as above\n%           ca. line 1600: moves instead of reloads, same as above\n\n% TODO: look for better formatting.

\\cref{lst:example1Pass} showcase the resulting assembly for the same source code location, when enabling our Annotation pass.\n\nWhen comparing the assembly in \\cref{lst:example1} with \\cref{lst:example1Pass} it is possible to observe the additional optimizations, that are enabled by annotating attributes to the functions \\texttt{MPI\\_Comm\\_size} and \\texttt{MPI\\_Comm\\_rank}.\nIn line 8 in \\cref{lst:example1,lst:example1Pass}, the generated assembly loads the size of the communicator into a register.\nWhereas the result of the addition is stored in the same register in line XXX of \\cref{lst:example1}, the compiler optimized the result to be stored in a different register in line XX of \\cref{lst:example1Pass}.\nThis enables the compiler to later reuse the communicator size from the register, which can be seen when comparing line 19 in \\cref{lst:example1,lst:example1Pass}.\nIn line 11 of \\cref{lst:example1,lst:example1Pass}, the previously initialized communicator rank is loaded from memory.\nAs above, in \\cref{lst:example1} the same value needs to be reloaded from memory in line 15.\nIn contrast, as the value is loaded into a different register in \\cref{lst:example1Pass} line 11 and copied into the register used for the function call in line 13.\nThe original value is still valid after the function call and can be used from there, without needing to load it again (refer to line 17 of \\cref{lst:example1Pass}).\n\nAs both of these values are reused again several times during the course of the entire program, this results in 12 memory accesses being saved.\n\nThe reason the compiler is able to perform these optimizations is the usage of the \\texttt{nocapture} attribute, annotated to the pointer parameter of both \\texttt{MPI\\_Comm\\_size} and \\texttt{MPI\\_Comm\\_rank}.\nThe compiler can use this information to be sure, that the values of the \\texttt{size} and \\texttt{rank} variables stay the same.\nWithout this attribute, the compiler needs to assume that the MPI library may change the variables at any time e.g. using a background thread and therefore needs fetch the current value (again) before each usage.\n\n% lulesh-init.s: ca. line 2705: loads instead of immediates\n%                                 -> transforms simple while-loops in do-while-loops\n%                                 -> directly increments copy of myRank\n%                                 -> does not reduce amount of memory accesses\n%                                       -> actually two more than previously\n%                                 -> side effect: reduces padding\n\nAnother exemplary difference is found in the produced Assembly code generated from the code in \\cref{lst:example2Source}.\n\n\\begin{listing}[ht]\n    \\centering\n    \\caption{Excerpt from \\texttt{lulesh-init.cc}}\n    \\label{lst:example2Source}\n    \\begin{minted}[linenos]{cpp}\nint myRank;\nMPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &myRank);\n// ...\nwhile (regionNum == lastReg) {\n    regionVar = rand() % costDenominator;\n    i = 0; // loop index can be transformed to start at myRank - 1\n    while (regionVar >= regBinEnd[i])\n        i++;\n    // a transformed index will save an addition in this line:\n    regionNum = ((i + myRank) % numReg()) + 1;\n}\n    \\end{minted}\n\\end{listing}\n\nAgain, the compiler is able to do additional optimizations because of the \\texttt{nocapture} attribute annotated to the pointer parameter of \\texttt{MPI\\_Comm\\_rank}.\nDespite the same attribute, the optimization is of a different kind.\nEssentially, the compiler is able to optimize the usage of the variable \\texttt{i} declared in line 6 of \\cref{lst:example2Source}.\nAs the compiler now knows that the value of \\texttt{myRank} does not change, it can perform an index transformation on the inner loop by basically initializing \\texttt{i} with \\texttt{myRank - 1}.\nThis will save the addition of \\texttt{i + myRank} after the loop (line 10 of \\cref{lst:example2Source}).\nThis implies that the compiler keeps a copy of \\texttt{myRank - 1} on the stack, to use in the next iteration of the outer loop.\n\nInterestingly, the load instruction for initialization of \\texttt{i} uses one byte less than the immediate-using instruction it replaces.\nTherefore, the compiler does not generate a subsequent padding in the machine code, which makes the code smaller and omits a following \\texttt{nop} instruction.\n\n\n\n%

6977/6947: can omit a few reloads\n\nLooking at a different part of LULESH it is possible to see another effect of our annotated attributes.\nThe following is an excerpt from a synchronization function that gets called for every simulated time step. % TODO: make sure that code is following immediately in final version, else reword this sentence\n\n\\begin{listing}[ht]\n    \\centering\n    \\caption{Excerpt from \\texttt{lulesh-comm.cc}}\n    \\label{lst:example3Source}\n    \\begin{minted}[linenos]{cpp}\nif (planeMax) {\n    srcAddr = &domain.commDataRecv[pmsg * maxPlaneComm];\n    MPI_Wait(&domain.recvRequest[pmsg], &status);\n    for (Index_t fi = 0 ; fi < xferFields; ++fi) {\n        Domain_member dest = fieldData[fi];\n        for (Index_t i = 0; i < opCount; ++i) {\n            (domain.*dest)(dx*dy*(dz - 1) + i) = srcAddr[i];\n        }\n        srcAddr += opCount;\n    }\n    ++pmsg;\n}\n    \\end{minted}\n\\end{listing}\n\nIn \\cref{lst:example3Source}, the variable \\texttt{fieldData} in line 5 is an array of function pointers that is initialized earlier and effectively constant, as it is never written thereafter.\nSince the variable \\texttt{xferFields} has the constant value of \\texttt{6}, the compiler is able to unroll the outer loop beginning in line 4.\nIdeally, the compiler should be able to statically resolve the function pointers and call the pointed-to functions in line 7 directly.\nCompiling this program reveals that the compiler is not able to do this.\nThe reason for this is that the compiler has no information on the MPI functions called beforehand, namely \\texttt{MPI\\_Wait} in line 3 and \\texttt{MPI\\_Comm\\_rank} in a line not shown.\nTherefore, it has to assume the worst case possible, which in these circumstances means that these functions modify the array contents to now point to different functions.\nUsing our annotation pass, \\texttt{MPI\\_Wait} and \\texttt{MPI\\_Comm\\_rank} both get annotated with the \\texttt{memory(argmem: readwrite, inaccessiblemem: readwrite)} attribute.\nBy including this annotation, the compiler is able to determine that the array contents are indeed not modified and can statically resolve the function call.\nThis only works in the first iteration however, as the called function itself is not marked with such attributes and therefore prevents further usage of this optimization.\nSince this is part of the internals of the application, additional attributes to the present MPI functions are not able to resolve this issue.\n\n%However, adding additional attributes to the functions behind the function pointers allows the compiler to resolve all these calls statically.\n%Adding attributes there, we can reduce the amount of instructions generated from this file by a total of about 140.\n%It is important to note, that doing these annotations needs the use of attributes that are not valid for the functions, but that still produce the right end result.\n\nNevertheless, even the single statically resolved function call causes major observable differences in the generated assembly.\nIn total, the compiler is able to replace 23 instructions at the call site.\n12 of those instructions compute the final location the function pointer points to, whereas the other 11 instructions are duplicated code whose execution depends on the function pointer (those instructions are used to prepare the function call e.g. push stack arguments).\n%Among the replaced instructions are up to three memory accesses and up to three jumps, varying with the control flow of the program.\n\nAdditionally, using the annotated attributes allows the compiler to keep other variables in registers, removing the need to reload values.\nIn total there are another 5 memory accesses less during the execution of the rest of this unrolled loop.\n\nUnfortunately, we were not able to measure a significant performance benefit of unrolling the first loop iteration and resolving the call to a direct one.\nAs the application prevents the resolval of the other calls in the loop, the performance benefit is limited in this case.\n\nNevertheless, this shows that valuable optimizations can be triggered by the addition of relevant attributes to MPI functions.\nWe see that the addition of attributes to MPI functions enables the compiler to statically resolve a function call to a direct one, which has the potential to enable further even more valuable optimizations, although they are not triggered in the case of LULESH.\nOn the other hand, there is no measurable compile time overhead associated with annotating MPI functions, meaning that although the optimizations have only a minimal impact on the runtime of LULESH, they are basically performed \"{}for free\"{}.\n\n\\subsubsection{Example: SimpleMOC}\nAnother set of possible optimizations result in more instructions being generated.\nAn example for this can be found when looking at the file \\texttt{main.c} in SimpleMOC, where several function calls are only made at the process with rank 0.\n% Code example?\nDue to the compiler having the additional information that the rank variable is not captured, it is able to eliminate branches.\nThis is done by duplicating the code that is executed by all processes.\nIn one of these duplicated regions the code specific for the process with rank 0 is included, whereas the other duplicated region does not have this code.\nIn total this omits three branches for process with a rank different from 0, and several tests for the value of rank in the other region.\nThe reason that this is not possible when compiling without our pass, is that the compiler has to assume that between different tests for the value of rank the value has been changed by a different thread or context, making multiple tests necessary.\nKnowing that the rank variable is not captured allows the compiler to omit these unnecessary tests.\nSeparating both cases additionally allows the compiler to use 32 bytes less stack space as it is able to keep more values in registers.\n\nEven though this increases the size of the produced object file significantly, less instructions are actually executed during runtime.\nAs the code is only executed once in the initial setup of the application, the performance benefit is only minimal.\nHowever, this shows that such optimizations are possible, with the potential of a bigger impact when employing our pass on other programs.\n\n% TODO: what happens in comms.c?\n%           - call to malloc is not optimized away (line 162)\n\n\\subsection{Impact on Exascale Proxy apps}\n\nThe impact of annotating MPI functions with relevant attributes is not limited to LULESH or SimpleMOC.\nAlso most other Exascale Proxy app are impacted.\nWe tested all Proxy apps that use C or C++ that could be build without the need for external dependencies.\nThis is shown in \\cref{fig:assembly-diff}, where the difference in the assembly instruction count of the resulting binary is depicted.\nFor some apps like LULESH, the annotations optimize the code in a way that leads to fewer instructions, by removing unnecessary ones.\nFor other apps like SimpleMOC, the optimizations results in more instructions, due to code duplication performed by the compiler when branches are eliminated, which was not possible without the annotations.\n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\t\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{media/assembly_counts.pdf}\n\\caption{Differences in assembly count for ECP proxy

              "Your draft summary presents a clear overview of the research findings and the implications of using LLVM attributes to optimize MPI applications. Let's expand on the topic of ABI standardization and how the approach presented in your work can contribute to guiding this standardization.\n\n**ABI Standardization and MPI**\n\nThe MPI Forum's discussions around standardizing an Application Binary Interface (ABI) for MPI are significant for interoperability and performance optimization across different MPI implementations and compilers. An ABI standard defines how functions, data structures, and other binary entities are represented in machine code, allowing different components of software (such as libraries and executables) to work seamlessly together.\n\n**Role of LLVM Attributes in ABI Guidance**\n\nThe use of LLVM attributes to annotate MPI functions with semantic information aligns well with the goals of ABI standardization. Here's how this approach can contribute to guiding ABI standardization efforts:\n\n1. **Consistency and Compatibility**: By manually choosing LLVM attributes that match the semantics of MPI functions as defined by the MPI standard, your approach ensures compatibility across various MPI implementations. This consistency in attribute usage can serve as a guideline for defining how MPI functions should behave in a standardized ABI.\n\n2. **Optimization Guidance**: The attributes provided to the compiler offer detailed insights into the behavior of MPI functions regarding memory access, pointer usage, and side effects. This information can be leveraged by ABI standards to specify optimization guidelines and expectations for MPI implementations.\n\n3. **Interoperability**: A standardized ABI for MPI would facilitate better interoperability between MPI libraries and applications compiled with different compilers. The use of LLVM attributes to optimize MPI functions can inform ABI discussions by showcasing how compilers can leverage standardized information for improved performance.\n\n**Future Directions and Fortran Compatibility**\n\nExpanding the research to include an analysis of register usage and exploring the applicability of LLVM attribute annotations to Fortran applications are valuable next steps. Fortran, like C and C++, can be compiled with the LLVM toolchain, making it feasible to extend your approach to Fortran-based MPI applications.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn summary, the approach of annotating MPI functions with LLVM attributes not only enables compiler optimizations but also aligns with the broader goals of MPI ABI standardization. Providing compilers with standardized semantic information through attributes can pave the way for more efficient and interoperable MPI implementations, benefiting the HPC community as a whole."

              "Research Paper:\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:intro}\n\n\nMPI stands as the cornerstone of distributed memory computing, serving as the de facto standard in facilitating large-scale distributed memory applications.\nHandling messages inside the MPI library is associated with a certain communication overhead.\nOne major technique to reduce this overhead is the overlapping of communication with computation by using non-blocking MPI operations.\nFor non-blocking operations, the network hardware can handle the message transfer, while the application continues its calculations.\nBut even in the case of non-blocking operations, MPI still needs to perform message matching based on the envelopes.\nA message envelope, as defined by the MPI standard~\\cite{mpi4}, consists of the MPI communicator used for communication, the target and destination processes (rank) as well as a user defined integer (message tag).\nMessage matching is crucial for programming correct applications, in order to distinguish different messages, so that and each message arrives at the desired location.\n\nIn some cases the message matching is superfluous, though.\nAn example is the usage of persistent MPI operations.\nIn a persistent MPI operation one first defines a message envelope and then sends repeated messages with the \\textbf{same} envelope.\nThis means that if a persistent send and receive operation match once, they will also match in every other iteration, making all operations spent to determine that those two operations will match again superfluous.\nHowever, the MPI standard does not mandate that a persistent send operation is matched by a persistent receive operation.\nAdditionally, several different persistent operations may use the same envelope.\nIn order to ensure a correct program execution, message matching is still required in those cases.\nTherefore, an MPI implementation is not allowed to just disable message matching for persistent MPI operations.\nHere, we see a potential to further reduce the overhead of MPI communication by eliminating the superfluous message matching in cases, where this is applicable.\nThis is especially beneficial to the performance of message passing, as the operations needed to perform the matching can not be overlapped with computation very well.\n\\citeauthor{Schonbein2018} identified the cost of message matching, especially in multi-threaded environments, as one component that adds the most overhead to MPI communication~\\cite{Schonbein2018}.\nBut the communication overhead does not only consist of envelope matching.\n\\citeauthor{Zambre2019} points out that for a non-blocking send operation, up to 90\\% of the overhead is spent within the MPI implementation whereas only less than 10\\% is spent in the lower levels of the software stack actually dealing with the network hardware~\\cite{Zambre2019}.\nBefore actually engaging with the network hardware the MPI library may perform various other steps such as checking if the data is contiguous, computing which communication interface and protocol to use, etc.\nSimilar to matching, these operations are also mostly superfluous if the same (persistent) MPI operation is executed repeatedly.\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\n\\TODO{vielleicht als separaten Related-Work-Abschnitt auslagern?}\nSeveral techniques to reduce the cost of message matching have been proposed.\nSome are software-based, like \\citeauthor{Flajslik2016} who propose to ``utilize a hash map that is extended with message ordering annotations\"~\\cite{Flajslik2016}. \\citeauthor{Flajslik2016}'s work is complementary to ours as it is mostly concerned with irregular communication patterns where matching wildcards are used, whereas ours focuses on regular communication patterns.\n\nMost studies are exploring hardware-based approaches, where specialized hardware is used to accelerate the message envelope matching instead of the CPU performing the required operations~ \\cite{Hemmert2007,Underwood2005,Xiong2018,Levy2019,Ferreira2019}.\nOne major drawback of these hardware-based approaches is, that they might not be able to adopt future changes in MPI usage.\nFor example, the current constraints of MPI message matching do not translate well to GPU architectures~\\cite{Klenk2017}.\nWe argue that in the case of redundant matching operations, it is better to utilize such hardware to perform tasks  relevant for the application, like in-network computing or reduction operations for example.\n\\\\\n\\\\\nIn terms of completely eliminating superfluous message matching operations, \\citeauthor{Jammer2022} have shown, that in some cases, the compiler can determine, that message matching is redundant~\\cite{Jammer2022} .\nThe idea is that the compiler can in some cases prove that all envelopes sent out are different and therefore, no \\enquote{matching conflict} can occur.\nIn order to guarantee a correct execution one needs to prove that no matching conflict can occur \\textbf{before} message matching is disabled.\nTherefore, speculatively disabling message matching is not a viable option.\n\nThe compiler-based approach by \\citeauthor{Jammer2022} is currently limited to only cover MPI calls that are inside of the same function~\\cite{Jammer2022}.\nAdditionally, a static analysis based approach can not always prove message envelope different, even if they are different during execution.\\\\\n\\\\\nTherefore, we propose to precompute all used MPI message envelopes before they are used to check for the presence of matching conflicts at runtime.\nThe compiler does however also play a crucial role in our approach as it is used to automatically generate the instructions necessary to precompute the used MPI message envelopes, so that no manual work by the programmer is needed in order to exploit the performance gain achieved by selective disabling of message matching when it is applicable.\\\\\n\\\\\n\nThis paper is structured as follows:\nFirst, we will introduce how we utilize the compiler to compute all message envelopes in \\cref{fig:analysis}.\nIn \\cref{sec:discussion} we will discuss, in which cases our approach does not work optimally, while providing a case study on a complex application in \\cref{sec:eval}.\nWe summarize and conclude with an overview over possible avenues of future work in \\cref{sec:conclusion}.\n\n\\section{Analysis Approach}\n\\label{sec:analysis}\n\nThe general idea of our approach is to precompute all used message envelopes before the program starts right after \\texttt{MPI\\_Init}.\nThen the MPI library can check all used envelopes for matching conflicts and disable message matching if applicable.\nThe compiler will automatically determine how to compute the message envelope used and insert the necessary instruction after the call to \\texttt{MPI\\_Init}.\nThis is done by generating a copy of the original program's instructions containing only the ones necessary for calculating the message envelopes.\nFor the precomputation, we only consider the message tag and source or destination process respectively.\nThis does not break correctness: If a subset of the envelope, as defined by the MPI standard, is already enough to tell different messages apart, the full envelopes including the communicator will also differ.\nWe don't consider the communicator as integral to the envelope as the tag and involved processes, as the programmer can easily also use a different range of tags in substitution of different communicators.\nEspecially as a significant portion of MPI communication operations directly use \\texttt{MPI\\_COMM\\_WORLD}~\\cite{Hueck2023}.\nNonetheless, the idea of precomputation can also be applied to the communicator tough.\\\\\n\\\\\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\t\\includegraphics[width=0.83\\linewidth,trim=0.9cm 7.8cm 3.0cm 1cm,clip]{media/analysis.pdf}\n\t\\caption{Illustration of the analysis process. Starting from the LLVM IR (1), first the message envelopes that should be precomputed are detected (2). Then, all instructions necessary for calculation and control flow are marked (3) and their side effects analyzed (4). The pass then generates the part of the program necessary for precomputation (5) and adds the handling of side effects (6). Finally (7), a call to the precompute phase is injected into \\texttt{main}, before the usual LLVM LTO optimizations pipeline is run (8), in order to produce a binary.}\n\t\\label{fig:analysis}\n\\end{figure}\nWe implemented a compiler transformation pass operating on the LLVM intermediate representation (IR).\nThe analysis and transformation workflow is illustrated in \\cref{fig:analysis}.\nWe will detail the necessary steps in the following section.\n\nThe compiler transformation will search for all MPI send/receive operations and mark the values (in LLVM IR) used as rank and tag parameters as ``necessary to precompute\"{}.\nThen the values used to compute the values marked as ``necessary to precompute\"{} are also marked recursively, until we arrive at a value known to the compiler (e.g. a constant value) or a value derived from the execution environment (such as a command line argument or the number of MPI processes present).\nWhen marking values as ``necessary to precompute\"{} the analysis also marks the instructions necessary for the control flow to reach the precomputed value as ``necessary to precompute\"{}.\nThis way, the generation of multiple envelopes inside a loop is also correctly handled.\nThis also happens recursively until we reach the program entry.\nWhen the compiler analysis does not find any remaining value that is ``necessary to precompute\"{}, it copies only those marked instructions.\nIn this regard, this is an application of program slicing techniques \\cite{Weiser1984}, as we extract the part of the program that is necessary for the calculation of the message envelopes used.\n\nThe MPI calls used to define send/receive envelopes are then replaced with a callback to the precompute backend library, that keeps track of all the values precomputed.\nThe information, which envelope belongs to which MPI operation is based on order of execution, as the order of calls to the precompute backend will match the order of MPI calls in the ``real\"{} execution of the application.\nAfter the precalculation of all the message envelopes is finished, the compiler inserts instructions, to make sure the program is in the same\\footnote{The state of the precompute backend library is excluded when determining this.} global state as it was in the beginning of the precomputation.\nThen, the normal execution of the program resumes.\nThis execution process is illustrated in \\cref{fig:execution}.\n\nThe following sections will detail how to handle complex control flows and side effects of the instructions necessary to precompute.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\includegraphics[width=0.83\\linewidth,trim=0.9cm 13cm 3.0cm 1cm,clip]{media/execution.pdf}\n\\caption{Illustration of the execution of an application altered by our pass. First (1) MPI is initialized like normal. Then (2) the precomputation phase starts, where all message envelopes are computed and registered to the backend library. After the precomputation phase, the original global state needs to be restored (3), before normal execution resumes (4).}\n\\label{fig:execution}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Global side effects}\n\\label{sec:side-effects}\nFor our analysis it is important to keep track of any side effects that may occur when executing the code that was determined necessary to precompute.\nIn this section we elaborate on how we handle possible side effects, so that they do not influence the execution of the application.\n\n\\subsubsection{Pointer aliasing}\nPointer aliasing is a key concern for many static analysis approaches.\nWhen determining whether a memory read operation is ``necessary to precompute\"{} our analysis also needs to mark any write operations to that location that might be executed before as ``necessary to precompute\"{}.\nA key challenge in our analysis is that we do not only need to determine all write operations happening to this pointer in the same function but in all other functions that may be executed before as well.\nTherefore, our analysis does not only consider pointer usages ``upwards\"{} (in the llvm def-use chain) to find the pointer origin (likely its allocation), but also its ``downward\"{} usages to find the write operations that are important.\nIf a pointer is passed to a function, our analysis will trace the pointer usages in this function.\nDuring this analysis, if we see that another pointer is derived and a new alias is created, we treat it the same as the original pointer.\nWhen determining the write operations that are important, our pass only considers those that can happen before the read of the value that was marked ``necessary to precompute\"{}.\nIn the case of two operations being in separate functions, their order is determined by the order of calls to the functions in question in their least common caller in the call hierarchy (at least \\texttt{main}).\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Memory management}\nIf the application allocates memory during the precomputation phase, the precompute library will intercept the allocation call in order  to keep track of the allocated memory, so that it will be freed after the precomputation phase.\nOur implementation is limited in the allocation calls it currently supports (see \\cref{sec:discussion}).\n\n\\subsubsection{Global variables}\nFor global variables, our pass will re-initialize them with their original value, after the precomputation phase has finished, if they could have been modified during the precomputation phase.\n%\\TODO{warum k\u00f6nnten die globalen Variablen ge\u00e4ndert worden sein? vielleicht ein kleines Beispiel?}\n% Reicht das, wenn man die Abschnitte einfach Tauscht?\n\n\\subsubsection{MPI library} For the state of the MPI library, there are no relevant side effects as our analysis is aware of the side effects of MPI operations.\nUsually, only side effect free operations are necessary to compute the message envelopes, like reading the rank of the current process or the number of processes.\nOur analysis would abort with an error if execution of other MPI operations was determined necessary for envelope computation.\nWe did not encounter this case in our evaluation, though.\n\n\\subsubsection{Execution environment}\nThe program may interact with its execution environment such as reading the command line arguments, environment variables or input files.\nFor the execution environment, reading from the environment is considered ``side effect free\" for our purposes, as it does not modify the environment, therefore executing code interacting with the execution environment in a read-only way is not harmful in the precomputation phase, as the ``real\"{} execution of the application can read the execution environment again.\nAny writing to the execution environment is therefore not allowed, though.\nBut modifying the execution environment should not be necessary in order to compute the message envelope used, as write operations have no ``result\"{} that can be used in order to derive a message envelope from it.\nWe will discuss in which cases this presents a limit to our approach in \\cref{sec:discussion}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Advanced C++}\n\\label{sec:advanced-cpp}\nOur pass operates on LLVM IR and is therefore capable of handling C as well as C++ codes.\nFor C++ there are some advanced language features, commonly challenging static analysis tools.\nWe further elaborate how our analysis can handle those features in this section.\n\n\\subsubsection{Templates}\nAs we operate on the LLVM IR level, the clang front-end has already correctly instantiated all templates, so there are no further implications for our analysis\n%TODO weglassen?\n\n\\subsubsection{Polymorphism}\nFor control-flow and call-graph analysis using complex inheritance hierarchies with polymorphic objects does present a challenge.\n\nPolymorphic objects are implemented with virtual tables (vtable) \\footnote{SOME CITATION about vtable?}.\nThis results in indirect calls in the LLVM IR, where the function pointer to call is first loaded from the vtable and then called.\nThe LLVM tool chain does already include a whole program de-virtualization pass that can be run during the LTO phase.\nWe piggybacked on the analysis part of this pass to determine the possible call sites for indirect calls.\n% If the de-virtualization does not yield a list of all possible call targets for a given call, we do consider all functions, which's pointer is somehow captured, as possible call targets.\nIf the de-virtualization does not yield a list of all possible call targets for a given call, we do consider all functions, whose pointer is somehow captured, as possible call targets.\n\nThe load of a function pointer that can lead to a callee that is marked as ``necessary to precompute\"{} is therefore also marked.\n% as explained above\nAs explained above in \\cref{sec:analysis} this leads to all relevant stores to also be marked.\nOur transformation then replaces the usage of the original function pointer with an altered one, so that instead of the original function, the altered one -- containing only the instructions ``necessary to precompute\"{} -- is called.\nThis means that the pass will create an alternative vtable that is used in the precompute phase, while the original one is still used after the precompute phase.\n\n\\subsubsection{Exceptions}\n\\label{sec:exception}\nExceptions may alter the control flow of a program, therefore we need to analyze them.\nIn most cases, our analysis actually ignores exceptions and aborts, as these are considered so harmful that the precomputation does not work correctly anyway.\nIn these cases, for example when the process is out of memory, it is very likely that the original application will also crash.\nHowever, for the exceptions that are properly handled by the original application, this approach is not sufficient.\nConsider the example sketched in \\cref{lst:exception}: In this case, the envelope to precompute depends either on the input data or is based on the default input, if there was some exception during file I/O.\n\\begin{lstlisting}[float=h,caption={Sketch of exception handling that cannot be ignored during our analysis},label=lst:exception]\nstruct input_parameters;\ntry{\ninput_parameters = Read_Input_File();\n}\ncatch (const std::system_error& e) {\n// catch I/O errors like file not found\ninput_parameters = default_input;\n}\ntarget_process=depends_on_input(input_parameters);\n\\end{lstlisting}\nThis case is correctly handled by our analysis as well.\nIn the LLVM IR, exceptions are handled with a \\texttt{landingpad} instruction.\nOur pass discovers that the \\texttt{landingpad} (analogous to the \\texttt{catch} statement in line 5 in \\cref{lst:exception}) is important, as the resulting value of \\texttt{target\\_process} does depend on it.\nThe analysis therefore marks all operations that can raise an exception caught by the \\texttt{landingpad} as ``necessary to precompute\"{}, so those are executed in the precompute phase to check if the exception is raised.\nThis approach does also work if -- in contrast to the code example in \\cref{lst:exception} -- the operation that raises the exception is not ``necessary to precompute\"{} in the exception-free case.\nFor optimization purposes, our analysis can ignore exceptions that result in diverging the control-flow completely away from the computations of message envelopes.\nExamples are exceptions that may be the result of writing to the execution environment (e.g. writing to stdout).\nThe compiler can generate exception handling code, when for example a write operation to stdout fails, as C++ semantics require that certain destructors are called in this case.\nWe discuss in which cases ignoring certain exceptions limits our approach in \\cref{sec:discussion}.\n\nOur analysis does work, even if the envelopes are spread across multiple translation units, as we run the compiler transformation pass at the Link Time Optimization (LTO) phase.\nIf a function needs to be called that is not part of the information that is available at the LTO phase, our analysis will abort with an error, unless the user explicitly marked this function as ``side-effect free if called during precompute phase\"{} with an environment variable.\n%Notiz: dieses Feature wird aber weiter gar nciht benutzt\n\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\\label{sec:discussion}\nIn this section we discuss the current shortcomings of our approach.\nFirst we will discuss the general limitations of our approach, before detailing some limitations in our implementation that we do not consider a general shortcoming of the precomputation idea.\n\n\\subsubsection{Limits of the approach in general}\nIn general, our approach only works with full LTO information, which can increase compile time\\footnote{SOME CITATION ABOUT LTO??}.\nOn the other hand, this also allows the application to reap the benefits obtained by LTO.\n\nThe current implementation does not include any heuristic to determine if precomputation is worth the effort.\nIf e.g. the application termination depends on the input data (i.e. on convergence) and then some messages are sent at the end of the program, the precompute phase needs to actually run the whole computationally intensive part of the program, in order to arrive at the point where those final message envelopes are computed.\nIn the future, we want to incorporate a heuristic that can find such cases and disable the precomputation if it does lead to too much runtime overhead.\n\n\\subsubsection{Limits of the current proof of concept implementation}\nAdditionally, there are some limitations in the current implementation, as described in \\cref{sec:analysis}.\n\nFirst, only memory allocations performed with \\texttt{malloc} or \\texttt{operator new} are supported to be intercepted by the current precomputation library.\nThis does not inhibit correctness however.\nThis can ``only\"{} lead to a memory leak in the precompute phase, if a different allocator is used, as the precomputation library does not intercept the call, in order to remember the memory to be freed afterwards.\nHowever, support for other allocators can be added in the future as well.\nSome additional engineering effort may also be required to allow for custom allocators, though.\n\nRegarding reading of the execution environment, a similar problem exists in the current implementation.\nThe current implementation can e.g. read input files, but those files are currently not properly closed, again leading to a resource leak.\nThe solution for this problem could also be intercepting of those operations by the precompute library, which will make sure to properly close all files after the precompute phase.\n\nReading from stdin is currently not supported, as it may require interactive input by the user.\nThis again is also only a drawback of our implementation and not our approach in general, as the precomputation library can capture stdin to an internal buffer or a file and then use the captured input after the precompute phase.\nWe did not however encounter a program where the used message envelopes depend on input from stdin.\nWe did not consider programs that write to the execution environment and then later expect to read these written values for further usage, as any process could change the environment in between.\n\\\\\n\\\\\nWhere our implementation can currently lead to unexpected or even undefined behavior is the handling of exceptions.\nAs discussed in \\cref{sec:exception}, most exceptions are actually ignored.\nFor example, consider reading the input arguments leads to an exception causing the program to print a help message about its arguments and then abort.\nIn this case, our analysis will ignore the exception handling for this exception, as no message envelope depends on it.\nThis can lead to a program crash without the help message being printed, resulting in a different program behavior than without the precompute phase.\nAs explained in \\cref{sec:exception} optimization, the precompute phase may even skip the check if the exception in question should be raised for optimization purposes.\nThis can lead to undefined behavior (i.e. if the wrong arguments are later used).\nWe do consider this as a limitation of our implementation that needs further investigation, as we want to avoid executing all exception checking code during the precompute phase for performance reasons.\nNevertheless, this is not a limitation inherent to our precomputation approach, as in the worst case, the precompute library can catch any unhandled exception thrown during the precompute phase and abort the precomputation.\nIn this case we can just tell the MPI library that matching conflicts may be present and proper message matching mechanisms need to be used, in order to continue like normal.\nWe choose to stay with the current implementation, as our assumption is that the user is capable of using the optimized program correctly and most programs do not handle exception in other ways than just aborting anyway.\nWe regard this choice similar to assertions, which are not included in release code.\n%\n%TODO is this relevant:\n%Worst Case: keep code of original bianry around and if something fails: just start original binary: guaranteed to work, even if some resosurce leaks or stale file handles are present.\n\n\\section{Evaluation}\n\\label{sec:eval}\n\nWe demonstrate the capabilities of our analysis by showcasing it on an N-body Simulation code: MUrB (MoveUrBody).\nThe code was developed by Adrien Cassange to showcase different implementations of N-Body Simulations using his MIPP SIMD wrapper~\\cite{cassange2018}.\nMUrB has roughly 42000 lines of C++ code spread across $\\approx$150 files\\footnote{This count does include the MIPP SIMD wrapper, as this dependency is included as a git submodule}.\nMUrB does use complex C++ features such as polymorphic inheritance and templates, which makes this code very challenging to analyse with static analysis tools.\nAdditionally, the communication scheme used does depend on the Implementation selected.\nThe user can choose the implementation to use via a command line parameter, the usage of one of the different implementations is then managed with polymorphic inheritance.\nTherefore, this code allows us to sufficiently showcase the capabilities of our Analysis approach, as a purely static tool would not be able to decide which implementation will be selected by the user at runtime.\n\n%Listing LISTING shows a \\emph{simplified} structure of the

to the MUrB code, we only needed to swap the compiler to use with a compiler wrapper, that passes the needed command line arguments to enable our transformation pass to clang during the cmake build step.\\\\\n\\\\\n%\\TODO{Das ist der Springende Punkt im paper, aber nimmt irgendwie wenig text ein...}\nOur compiler pass successfully transforms the application to include a precompute phase.\nThe application transformed by our pass behaves like the original one.\nThe only exception it the  wrong usage of command line arguments, where the altered application just crashes, while the original one prints a help message (see \\cref{sec:exception}).\\\\\n\\\\\nWhen knowing all message envelopes, one can see that MUrB uses distinct message tags for each pair of persistent send/receive operations, so that message matching is not observe  a performance benefit, detailed in \\cref{tab:eval}.\n\n\\TODO{Measurement setup beschreiben (system)}\n\nAs the optimization only targets the communication overhead, we do not expect to see a very high overall performance benefit, considering that a high computation-communication overlap is already present in MUrB.\nStill, a performance benefit, that

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a complex C++ application, achieving performance gains despite the overhead of precomputation. Our method handles advanced language features like polymorphism and exceptions, ensuring correctness while enhancing communication performance. Future work includes heuristic refinement for optimized precomputation and exploration of static analysis techniques to reduce envelope precomputation. The implementation is available for reproducibility and further research."

              "Here's an improved version of the introduction:\n\nMPI stands as the cornerstone of distributed memory computing, serving as the de facto standard in facilitating large-scale distributed memory applications. While MPI greatly enhances communication in such systems, it comes with inherent costs, particularly in handling messages within the MPI library. One prominent technique to mitigate this overhead is the overlapping of communication with computation, achieved through non-blocking MPI operations. These operations enable the network hardware to handle message transfer while the application continues its calculations. Nevertheless, even with non-blocking operations, MPI must still perform message matching based on message envelopes. Defined by the MPI standard, a message envelope encompasses the MPI communicator, target and destination processes (rank), and a user-defined integer (message tag). Accurate message matching is vital for ensuring correct application behavior, enabling the distinction between different messages and their arrival at the intended destinations.\n\nHowever, in certain scenarios, message matching becomes redundant. An instance of this is observed in the utilization of persistent MPI operations, where a message envelope is defined initially, and subsequent messages with the same envelope are sent repeatedly. Consequently, if a persistent send and receive operation match initially, they will continue to match in subsequent iterations, rendering the repeated matching operations unnecessary. Despite this, the MPI Standard does not mandate that a persistent send operation must be matched by a persistent receive operation. Moreover, multiple persistent operations may utilize the same envelope, necessitating message matching to ensure program correctness. Consequently, an MPI implementation cannot simply disable message matching for persistent MPI operations.\n\nThere lies an opportunity to further reduce MPI communication overhead by eliminating superfluous message matching in applicable cases. This holds particular significance for the performance of message passing, given that the operations required for message matching cannot be effectively overlapped with computation.\n\nSeveral techniques have been proposed to diminish the cost of message matching, as evidenced by various studies (CITATIONS NEEDED). In the quest to entirely eliminate redundant message matching operations, Jammer et al. (2022) have demonstrated that, in certain instances, compilers can ascertain the redundancy of message matching. Their approach relies on the compiler's ability to prove that all envelopes sent out are distinct, thereby obviating any potential \"matching conflicts.\" However, before switching off message matching, it's imperative to establish, with certainty, the absence of matching conflicts to ensure correct program execution. Therefore, speculative disabling of message matching is deemed unfeasible.\n\nDespite the promise of the compiler-based approach, its current limitations confine it to MPI calls within the same function. Moreover, static analysis may fall short in proving message envelope differences, even when they exist during execution. Consequently, we propose a runtime-based approach, involving the precomputation of all MPI message envelopes before usage to detect matching conflicts. Crucially, the compiler plays a pivotal role in our methodology, automating the generation of instructions necessary for precomputing MPI message envelopes. This alleviates the need for manual intervention by programmers, facilitating the exploitation of performance gains attained through the selective disabling of message matching when applicable."

This can help users to chose the optimal tool for their use cases, and also aid mpi correctness developers in improving and extending their correctness checking capabilities.\n\n% -> tool devs need to support common features, one of the ansprueche of corr benchs are to provide assessment and support in improving support\n% hence, our reseaerch question is: Do corr benches adequately represent real world usage of MPI features.\n\nMPI is the de-facto standard for distributed computations in HPC\\@.\nThe interface, however, is low-level and error-prone as data is transferred as a type-less pointer to a buffer, and the user has to specify, e.g., the datatype and data length manually.\nMPI libraries typically provide little error checking, and the MPI standard does not guarantee consistent or reliable error handling~\\cite[Section~2.8]{mpi4}.\n% \\begin{quote} \n% \\enquote{MPI may not be able to detect some errors; other errors may be too expensive to detect in normal execution mode; [...]}\n% \\end{quote} \n\nConsequently, MPI correctness tools have been developed~\\cite{droste2015mpi,umpire,hilbrich2010must,saillard2014parcoach,2021:intel:itac} to aid the development of bug-free MPI codes.\nFor instance, several dormant bugs in popular mini-applications used for benchmarking in HPC have only been uncovered after years of usage~\\cite{droste2015mpi,umpire}.\nThe correctness tools need to support commonly used MPI features and check for related correctness issues to be useful for MPI users.\n\nTo aid these efforts, two MPI correctness benchmark suites have recently been developed, namely the \\emph{MPI-CorrBench}~\\cite{mpicorrbench,jammer2022corrbench} and the \\emph{MPI Bugs Initiative}~\\cite{mpibugsini}. \nBoth represent a \\emph{standardized test harness} that contains small-scale tests with correct and erroneous use of the MPI library, ranging from illegal argument values to deadlocks and data races. %\\footnote{MPI-CorrBench also contains hybrid MPI+OpenMP tests and mini-applications that we do not consider in this work to keep the results comparable.}\nHence, the correctness benchmarks help\n(a)~correctness tool developers with prioritizing development effort to improve and extend their tools checking capabilities, and\n(b)~code developers with assessing correctness tools for their particular needs.\n\n% Clearly, the correctness benchmarks need to provide MPI (mis-)~usage representative of real-world MPI use for the correctness tools developers to be able to assess and provide real-world MPI error checking to benefit the MPI code developers ultimately.\n\n% To assess the real-world applicability of MPI correctness tools, the correctness benchmarks should therefore encompass representative MPI (mis-)usage scenarios. \n% This approach enables correctness tool developers to refine and optimize error checking in accordance to real-world MPI use in HPC codes, ultimately benefiting MPI code developers.\n% Hence, our research question is:\n\nTo assess the real-world applicability of MPI correctness tools, the correctness benchmarks should encompass representative MPI (mis-)~usage scenarios encountered in HPC codes.\nSuch coverage enables correctness tool developers to refine and optimize error checking according to practical MPI usage, ultimately benefiting MPI code developers.\nHence, our research question is:\n\n\\begin{itemize}[leftmargin={*},label={}]\n\\item \\emph{How closely do the correctness benchmarks mirror the MPI usage of real-world HPC codes regarding MPI test cases?}%correct and erroneous MPI test cases?\n\\end{itemize}\n\nWe utilize our previously collected data set to answer this question, containing MPI usage at function- and argument-granularity of $96$~HPC codes~\\cite{mpistudy23}. \nThis data set contains a classification for each detected MPI call \\emph{and} their parameters, e.g., the third argument of a \\texttt{\\small{}MPI\\_Recv} operation is extracted and categorized as \\texttt{\\small{}DATATYPE}\\@.\nWe compare this data set with the MPI (argument) usage in the correctness benchmarks.\nThe benchmarks' proximity to real-world MPI usage is determined based on factors such as the presence of specific MPI functions like \\texttt{\\small{}MPI\\_Allreduce}, along with considering the frequency of their arguments, such as \\texttt{\\small{}MPI\\_SUM} being the most commonly found reduction operation in the data set.\nOur proposed scoring \n%obtained by comparing the MPI usage of the correctness benchmarks against the large data set, \nserves to assess the current state of representativeness and provides a guideline for continuously improving the coverage of representative MPI usage in these correctness benchmarks.\n\n% Our proposed scoring by comparing the MPI usage of the correctness benchmarks against the large data set can therefore be used to assess the current state of representativeness but, more importantly, give a guideline and continuous assessment for improving coverage of representative MPI usage in these benchmarks.\n\n\n\\section{MPI Feature Usage

\\label{fig:toolchain}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\figref{fig:toolchain} shows our toolchain that classifies MPI usage at argument granularity based on a set of input codes.\n% The MPI-4 standard~\\cite{mpi4} comprises over 600 routines covering communication routines and other related features to facilitate distributed computations, including collective, point-to-point (PtP), and one-sided communication.\nIt automatically classifies MPI calls and their arguments based on a structure closely resembling the MPI standard~\\cite{mpi4},~\\seeci{mpistudy23} for details.\n\n% Hence, for each MPI call in a target, we classify the cal\n\n\n% This classification is utilized for our correctness benchmark categorization.\n\n\n% By applying this tool to the correctness benchmarks and comparing the results with the data from our previously collected data set of 96 HPC codes, we can assess the benchmarks' closeness to real-world MPI usage.\n\n\n% \\subsection{MPI Classification}\n% and the assessment of the correctness benchmarks are based on the feature classification giv\n\n\n% \\subsection{Analysis Tooling}\n\n% static analysis has some weaknesses: unknown handles etc.\n% dynamic analysis removes some of the weaknesses, however: for corr benches, deadlock means some calls in static data are never executed with dynamic data. (good synergy here). however*2, what does it mean when a call will never execute in corr bench, should it count (maybe under some mpi libs it can execute...)?\n\n% The MPI usage data set of $96$~HPC codes was created with static source text analysis only to avoid dependencies of any particular software requirements.\n% This leads to cases where MPI arguments cannot be resolved when, e.g., compile-time dependent macro definitions are used to set the MPI datatype.\n% While this is acceptable for such a large-scale analysis, for the correctness benchmarks, we added a dynamic analysis part that can resolve such uncertainties by tracing all relevant MPI calls and their arguments.\n% Merging the static database of the correctness benchmark with the dynamically created thus leads to a precise data set of MPI use.\n\nThe MPI usage data set of $96$~HPC codes (henceforth, called \\emph{HPC data set}) was generated through static source text analysis, ensuring independence from any specific software, hardware or build system requirements.\nHowever, static analysis may encounter cases where MPI arguments cannot be resolved, particularly when compile-time dependent macro definitions are used to set, e.g., the MPI datatype.\nHence, the parameter set contains the classification wildcard \\emph{Other Parameter} for some MPI calls. %to indicate this limitation.\n\nTo address this limitation for the correctness benchmarks, we added a runtime analysis component capable of tracing all relevant MPI calls and their runtime argument values using the MPI profiling interface (PMPI).\n% , resolving uncertainties that arise from static analysis.\nBy merging the static database with the dynamically generated one, we obtain a precise and comprehensive data set of MPI usage patterns for the correctness benchmarks.\n\n\\subsection*{Scoring MPI Usage Pattern}\\label{sec:scoring}\n\nFor each MPI feature category, we calculate a percentage value representing the coverage of the correctness benchmarks regarding the MPI usage patterns found in the HPC data set.\nHence, a score of $100$\\% indicates a complete coverage of the MPI usage patterns. % found in the HPC data set.\n\n\n\\paragraph{Scoring Contribution}\nWe compare if an MPI call is present and match their relevant MPI arguments to obtain the scoring.\nOnly if both match, they are counted towards the final score.\nIf the HPC data set contains the aforementioned \\emph{Other Parameter} category, it is treated as a wildcard where the correctness benchmark's particular argument always matches.\n%We consider the following parameters to be core for our usage pattern analysis, and they are matched as follows:\nIn the following, we list the relevant parameters that we consider to be the core MPI usage pattern and how we match the data sets.\n% The \\emph{Other} category is always treated as a wildcard match for each parameter.\n\\begin{itemize}[leftmargin={*}]\n\\item \\emph{Datatype} and \\emph{Reduction Operator}: \\emph{Datatype} includes built-in and derived MPI datatypes.\nThere must be an exact match.\n% \\item \\emph{Reduction Operation}: There must be an exact match\n\\item \\emph{Count}: The count must match. In particular, we consider the combination of count and datatype to be integral for our scoring.\n\\item \\emph{Rank}: The rank must match only for the MPI \\emph{collective} category.\nWe believe the rank has particular importance in this category and less so in, e.g., \\emph{PtP} communication.\n\\item \\emph{Tag}: We match the \\texttt{\\small{}ANY\\_TAG}, other values are treated as wildcards. Evaluating discrete tag values (e.g., \\(1\\) or \\(8\\)) has no particular merit for our coverage metrics.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe scoring contribution is weighted according to usage frequency.\nAssume the HPC data set contains nine \\texttt{\\small{}Allreduce} and one \\texttt{\\small{}Reduce} call with various argument variations.\nTo score $100$\\%, the correctness benchmark must include both the \\texttt{\\small{}Allreduce} and \\texttt{\\small{}Reduce} calls with all parameter variations.\nIf the \\texttt{\\small{}Reduce} is fully matched, but out of nine \\texttt{\\small{}Allreduce} calls with, e.g., eight \\texttt{\\small{}MPI\\_DOUBLE} and one \\texttt{\\small{}MPI\\_FLOAT} datatype arguments, only the \\texttt{\\small{}MPI\\_FLOAT} case is covered by the correctness benchmark, the score for \\emph{Reductions} is $20$\\%.\n\n\\paragraph{Other MPI usage patterns}\nIf there are calls without the aforementioned parameter categories, such as \\texttt{\\small{}MPI\\_Wait}, we match only the MPI call.\nWe consider these other parameters not to be core MPI usage patterns for our analysis.\n\n\\section{Evaluation}\\label{sec:evaluation}\nWe evaluate MPI-CorrBench v$1.2.1$ (COBE) and MPI Bugs Initiative v$1.0.0$ (MBI) w.r.t.\\ their coverage of MPI use against the statically collected HPC data set.\nCOBE contains $510$ ($202$ correct and $308$ erroneous) test case files, while MBI has $1691$ ($697$ correct and $994$ erroneous) test case files.\nThe test timeouts (e.g., for deadlocks) are set to $30$~s and $120$~s for COBE and MBI, respectively.\nCOBE also contains hybrid MPI+OpenMP tests and mini-applications that we do not consider in this evaluation to keep the results comparable.\nWe show the total score and, subsequently, individual scores of the most essential MPI categories.\nFinally, the weighting of the coverage is presented.\nIt is based on the occurrence frequency in the HPC data set.\nFor all evaluations, we do not consider the MPI functions \\texttt{\\small{}MPI\\_Comm\\_rank}, \\texttt{\\small{}MPI\\_Comm\\_size}, \\texttt{\\small{}MPI\\_Init}, \\texttt{\\small{}MPI\\_Finalize} and \\texttt{\\small{}MPI\\_Init\\_thread}.\nWe believe these are core to MPI applications and hence add no value to coverage metrics.\n\n\n\\begin{table}[bht]\n\\small\n    \\centering\n    \\caption{Total MPI coverage score w.r.t.\\ the HPC data set.}\\label{tab:score}\n    \\begin{tabular}{lccc}\n        \\toprule\n             & Total (\\%) & Correct (\\%) & Erroneous  (\\%)\\\\\n        \\midrule\n        COBE & 39.26       & 36.53         & 23.13 \\\\\n        MBI  & 28.88       & 28.88         & 28.88 \\\\\n        \\bottomrule\n    \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\begin{figure*}[tbh]\n  \\centering\n  %  trim={<left> <lower> <right> <upper>}\n  \\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.4\\textwidth}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.85\\linewidth,trim=0cm 0cm 0cm 0cm,clip]{media/correct-testcases.pdf}\n    \\caption{Correct MPI test cases.}\\label{fig:scoring:corr}\n  \\end{subfigure}\n  \\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.4\\textwidth}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.85\\linewidth,trim=0cm 0cm 0cm 0cm,clip]{media/faulty-testcases.pdf}\n    \\caption{Erroneous MPI test cases.}\\label{fig:scoring:err}\n  \\end{subfigure}%\n  \\caption[Scoring per MPI category]{Scoring per MPI category for each MPI correctness benchmark.

In contrast, the correct reductions cover the calls but miss many argument variations for a higher score.\n% Similarly, collectives\n% We only consider MPI calls, not their parameters, \\seefig{fig:mpi_function_counts}.\n% We see that MBI does not cover $172$ MPI routines that are present in the HPC data set.\n% Overall, however, the highly weighted routines, such as \\emph{collectives} and, in particular \\emph{reductions}, are mostly covered.\n% COBE does not cover $202$ routines.\n% Crucially, COBE lacks tests for \\texttt{\\small{}Allreduce} and has only one \\texttt{\\small{}Reduce} test although these routines have a high usage in the HPC data set and hence a high scoring weight.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[bth]\n  \\centering\n

\\seesec{sec:scoring}.\nIn MBI we detect little use of the \\texttt{\\small{}MPI\\_DOUBLE} datatype.\nIt is only used for the construction of the derived datatype \\texttt{\\small{}contiguous}.\nIn contrast, this datatype is used often in the HPC data set, which causes the score of MBI to be lowered.\nCOBE has comparatively more \\texttt{\\small{}MPI\\_DOUBLE} usage but still lacks sufficient coverage.\nWhile conceptually similar, mismatches between data types like integer and float versus integer and double may require distinct handling by correctness tools.\nFor instance, a tool solely checking datatype size will encounter failures in these scenarios.\nBoth benchmarks lack sufficient tests with custom communicators.\nIn the HPC data set, we observe the usage of, e.g., \\texttt{\\small{}Comm\\_split} for collective communication that is underrepresented in the benchmarks.\nConstructed communicators may introduce mismatches not present in codes with \\texttt{\\small{}MPI\\_COMM\\_WORLD}-only usage.\nHence, these benchmarks should include such tests to assess correctness tool handling.\n% Crucially, COBE lacks tests for \\texttt{\\small{}\\small{}Allreduce} and has only one \\texttt{\\small{}\\small{}Reduce} test although these collective have a high usage in the HPC data set and hence a high scoring weight.\n\n\n\\paragraph{Which categories are not in the HPC data set?}\nFor MBI, we observe only the collectives \\texttt{\\small{}MPI\\_Iexscan} and \\texttt{\\small{}MPI\\_Iscan} that are absent in the HPC data set. \nCOBE includes more calls absent from the HPC data set, such as several non-blocking collective and one-sided routines, which mostly originate from the integrated MPI library test suite.\n\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\\label{sec:conclusion}\n\n% Our study presents a comparison of test coverage of the correctness benchmarks, MPI-CorrBench and the MPI Bugs Initiative, w.r.t.\\ MPI usage patterns in a set of $96$~HPC codes.\n% To that end, we compared which MPI calls are present in both and, also, looked at the parameters used in the HPC data set.\n% We score the presence of this combination in the respective correctness benchmark according to the weight (of appearance) in the HPC data set. \n% A higher weight indicates that certain MPI calls are detected more often and hence have more importance for the MPI developers.\n% Correctness benchmarks should cover these particular MPI calls to contain correct (and erroneous) MPI use with real-world relevancy.\n% In particular, COBE lacks crucial reduction operations and MBI lacks tests with the \\texttt{\\small{}MPI_DOUBLE} datatype.\n% In summary, our scoring can serve as a guide for improving the coverage of MPI usage patterns found in HPC application.\n\n\nOur study compares the test coverage of the MPI-CorrBench, and the MPI Bugs Initiative correctness benchmarks w.r.t.\\ MPI usage patterns in a set of $96$~HPC codes.\nWe assess the presence of MPI calls \\emph{and} their parameters in both benchmarks. % w.r.t.\\ the HPC data set.\nScoring is based on the weight (frequency of appearance) in the HPC data set, reflecting the importance of specific MPI usage patterns for developers.\nCorrectness benchmarks should encompass these essential MPI calls to ensure coverage of correct (and erroneous) real-world MPI usage.\nWe identified that COBE lacks crucial reduction operations, and MBI lacks tests with the \\texttt{\\small{}MPI\\_DOUBLE} datatype.\nIn conclusion, our scoring guides for improving the coverage of MPI usage patterns in HPC applications.\n\n% In the future, we want to investigate hybrid MPI+OpenMP test cases.\n\n\\appendix\n\\section{Reproducibility Setup} \nTo generate our coverage data for each correctness benchmark, we need to \n(1)~build our PMPI-based interceptor library to trace MPI usage,\n(2)~modify MPI-CorrBench and MPI Bugs Initiative to execute their tests with our PMPI tool to generate the traces,\n(3)~use our Python-based MPI usage analysis tool to merge the resulting trace with the statically collected MPI usage database, and\n(4)~execute it again to generate the final coverage data of the HPC data set.\n\nOur artifact repository is available at \\url{https://github.com/tudasc/mpi-bench-scoring}. \nIt contains scripts to facilitate the tracing and subsequent scoring of the MPI correctness benchmarks.\n%As a basis for our comparison, we used an up-to-date Ubuntu 20.04 workstation with OpenMPI 4 and Clang/LLVM 12 as the developer environment.\nWe have also added a continuous integration setup using GitHub Actions to illustrate the scoring workflow.\n\ngive me key points for a presentation slide about the motivation of this work"

MPI (Message Passing Interface) is a crucial standard for distributed computing in HPC (High-Performance Computing).\n\n2. MPI's low-level interface can be error-prone, and MPI libraries offer limited error checking.\n\n3. MPI correctness tools have been developed to help identify and fix MPI code errors.\n\n4. The effectiveness of these tools relies on their ability to support commonly used MPI features and check for related correctness issues.\n\n5. To aid tool developers and code developers, MPI correctness benchmarks have been created.\n\n6. These benchmarks contain standardized test cases, including both correct and erroneous MPI usage, and help evaluate the quality of MPI correctness tools.\n\n7. The key question is: How closely do these correctness benchmarks represent real-world MPI usage patterns in HPC codes?\n\n8. Answering this question can guide the development of better MPI correctness benchmarks and help improve the quality of MPI correctness tools."

              "Your presentation draft appears to cover the key aspects of your research and effectively conveys your findings. However, without the content of the research paper itself, I can provide some general feedback and suggestions:\n\n1. **Visuals**: You have used some visuals like logos and diagrams, which is great for engaging the audience. Make sure these visuals are clear and of high quality. Ensure that the audience can easily read the text and understand the diagrams.\n\n2. **Motivation Slide**: Your motivation slide clearly states the problem you're addressing and your research question. It's important to grab the audience's attention at the beginning, and this slide does a good job of that.\n\n3. **Example Usage Pattern**: Providing concrete examples can help the audience understand the practical implications of your research. You've done this effectively by presenting code snippets.\n\n4. **Analyzing Real-world MPI Usage Patterns**: The diagram here looks complex. Ensure that you explain it clearly during the presentation. If the audience can't understand the diagram, its purpose is lost.\n\n5. **Correctness Benchmarks Scoring**: You've explained how the scoring is done clearly, which is essential for the audience to understand the evaluation process.\n\n6. **Benchmark's MPI Coverage Score**: The table and bar chart provide a clear visual representation of your results. It's a good practice to highlight key takeaways from the table (e.g., MPI-Corrbench's correctness coverage is 36.53%).\n\n7. **Scores per Category**: Again, clear visuals. Ensure that you explain the purpose of this slide during the presentation.\n\n8. **Missed Score**: The comparison of erroneous and correct test cases is valuable. Make sure to point out the major differences and what they imply for each benchmark.\n\n9. **Conclusion**: You've summarized your findings effectively. Mentioning the room for improvement is a strong point. \n\n10. **Backup Slides**: You mentioned these are backup slides. This is a good practice, as it allows you to address more in-depth questions if the audience has them.\n\nIn terms of room for improvement, you've mentioned that both benchmarks have room for improvement, particularly in using communicators other than `COMM_WORLD`. To enhance this part of your presentation, you could:\n\n- Provide specific examples of MPI scenarios where these benchmarks fall short. What types of real-world applications or use cases are not well covered?\n- Suggest improvements or enhancements that could be made to these benchmarks to better align with real-world MPI usage patterns.\n- Consider discussing the potential impact of these improvements. How might they benefit developers, researchers, or the HPC community in general?\n\nOverall, your presentation draft appears to align with the content of your research paper and provides a good structure for presenting your findings. However, the effectiveness of your presentation will also depend on your delivery, so be sure to practice and make adjustments as needed based on your audience's understanding and feedback."

The `\\rowcolor` command is used to color the first row of the table, and the `\\hline` command is used to draw the horizontal lines. To color the column divider lines, you can use the `arrayrulecolor` command before the `tabular` environment. Here's an updated example:\n\n```\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage[table]{xcolor}\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\begin{center}\n{\\renewcommand{\\arraystretch}{1.5}\n\\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{0.2cm}\n\\renewcommand{\\arrayrulecolor}{gray}\n\\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c|c| }\n\\hline\n\\rowcolor{lightgray}\nColumn 1 & Column 2 & Column 3 & Column 4 \\\\\n\\hline\n1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n\\hline\n5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}}\n\\end{center}\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\nIn this updated example, the `arrayrulecolor` command is used to set the color of the column divider lines to gray. The `{\\renewcommand{\\arraystretch}{1.5} \\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{0.2cm}}` code is used to reduce the spacing between rows and columns, which helps to make the table more compact."

However, the error \"undefined control sequence\" typically occurs when you are using an unrecognized command or there is a syntax error in the code.\n\nThe issue in your code is that you have not provided any content inside the `tcbposter` environment, and you are missing the `\\end{tcbposter}` to close the environment. Additionally, there is an extra closing square bracket (]) at the end of the code.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use the `tcbposter` environment:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{tcolorbox}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\\begin{tcbposter}[\n    poster={columns=4,rows=7,spacing=1cm},\n]\n% Add your content here\n\\end{tcbposter}\n\\end{document}\n```\n\nMake sure to place your content within the `tcbposter` environment between the `\\begin{tcbposter}` and `\\end{tcbposter}` commands.

              "I apologize for the confusion. The \"Undefined control sequence\" error is not related to the `tcolorbox` package or the `tcbposter` environment. The error message is typically generated when LaTeX encounters an unrecognized command or an error in the code.\n\nSince the code you provided is correct and doesn't include any unrecognized commands, the issue might be caused by some other part of your LaTeX document. To diagnose the problem, I would need to see more of your document code.\n\nHere are some steps you can try to troubleshoot the issue:\n\n1. Make sure you have correctly installed the `tcolorbox` package. Sometimes, errors can occur if the package is not installed properly.\n\n2. Check for any other errors or misspellings in your document that might be causing the \"Undefined control sequence\" error. Look for any other commands or environments that could be causing conflicts.\n\n3. If possible, try creating a minimal working example (MWE) with only the `tcbposter` environment in a new LaTeX document. This can help isolate the issue and identify if it's related to other parts of your document.\n\n4. Ensure that your LaTeX distribution and packages are up to date.\n\nIf the issue persists, please provide more context or code from your document, and I'll do my best to help you further troubleshoot the problem."

              "\\section{Introduction}\\label{sec:introduction}\nThe Message-Passing Interface~(MPI,~\\cite{mpi4}) is the de-facto standard used for scalable High-Performance Computing (HPC), offering a large number of routines for\n \\begin{enuma}\n\\item communication,\n\\item File~I/O,\n\\item de\\-rived datatypes and\n\\item other functionality to enable efficient distributed computations.\n\\end{enuma}\nThe initial MPI standard release defined about 130 routines, whereas, with the continuous addition of features, the current 4.0 standard now defines over 600.\n\nVarious approaches have been used in the recent past to gain insights into the usage of MPI features, including \n\\begin{enuma}\n\\item user surveys~\\cite{bernholdtsurveyusexa,horisurveyintl}, \n\\item dynamic analysis of (proxy) applications~\\cite{klenkmpi,chundurimpi}, \n\\item static analysis~\\cite{2019:laguna:mpi-study} or \n\\item a combination of the latter two approaches~\\cite{sultanaspecialmpi}.\n\\end{enuma}\nThe study by Laguna et al.~\\cite{2019:laguna:mpi-study} stands out as the most comprehensive one, as it statically analyzed 110 open-source HPC codes.\nThe study provides an overview of categorized MPI features, including their required MPI version and, the minimum MPI standard required based on the detected MPI usage.\nWhile approximately 80\\% of the codes only required features up to the second MPI standard release, overall, many of the available MPI features were used. % This should read as, some part of available features were in use\nThe study also showed that MPI is often combined with other (multi-threading) paradigms (i.e., MPI+X), OpenMP~\\cite{openmp} being used in almost 50\\% of the codes.\n\n\nThe findings of such studies are valuable for the HPC community, as they can help the MPI standard body shape future revisions for improved interoperability of, e.g., different paradigms such as OpenMP, and also help MPI library developers prioritize their (e.g., optimization) efforts towards the most commonly used features.\n\n\nSimilarly, the MPI correctness community benefits from such studies, as their debuggers and tools~\\cite{droste2015mpi,hilbrich2010must,saillard2014parcoach,2021:intel:itac} need to support commonly used features in HPC codes to be useful to MPI users.\n%MPI correctness tools~\\cite{droste2015mpi,hilbrich2010must,saillard2014parcoach,2021:intel:itac} should support commonly used features in HPC codes to be useful to MPI users. %, such as derived datatype correctness checking~\\cite{2018:hueck:typeart}.\nRecently, MPI correctness benchmarks have been developed~\\cite{mpicorrbench,mpibugsini,jammer2022corrbench} to help guide these efforts.\nThey aim to provide a standardized test suite for correctness tools by providing codes ranging from small-scale unit tests to mini-applications that contain erroneous use of MPI\\@.\nHence, MPI users can assess the relevant feature support of existing tools for their application.\nLikewise, these benchmarks can be used by tool developers to improve implementation quality and guide new feature support.\nCorrectness benchmarks should therefore reflect MPI usage in HPC applications and, to that end, the study of Laguna et al.\\ can provide guidance. % of such tests.\n\n\nWhile the Laguna et al.'s study provides a useful overview, it only analyzed these HPC codes at the granularity of function call sites by statically matching MPI function names. % line by line.\nHowever, further insight can be gained by also analyzing the parameters of these calls.\nFor instance, MPI offers an interface for constructing derived datatypes, exposed as opaque handles to the user, which represent potentially complex user data structures~\\cite[\\sectionname~5]{mpi4}. % using opaque handles.\nThe user can, for example, recursively construct complex memory overlays to define a vector of a structure type.\nWithout matching function call arguments, we can not deduce the interplay of these datatype constructors, \\seelst{lst:mpi:derived}. %opaque handles as specified by the MPI user, \\seelst{lst:mpi:derived}.\nKnowledge of this interplay is beneficial for improving datatype correctness checking~\\cite{2018:hueck:typeart} but also for library developers to focus further optimizations of common datatype construction~\\cite{gropp2011performance}.\n\nTo better understand the use of MPI handles and, in general, user behavior in calling MPI functions, we present a survey based on a static analysis of call sites \\emph{and} arguments, partially based on the set of HPC codes analyzed in the study of Laguna et al.\n\nAt a high-level, our tool chain \n\\begin{enuma} \n\\item matches MPI function calls, then\n\\item extracts arguments (variables or constants) and categorizes these as \\emph{buffer handle}, \\emph{datatype} (opaque handle), etc.\\ and finally\n\\item cross-references these opaque handles w.r.t.\\ use in other function calls.\n\\end{enuma} \nThe latter generates connections between, e.g., the handle of a type constructor and, say, an MPI send operation call.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n  % \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=.98\\linewidth,trim=1.815cm 21.6cm 11.5cm 3cm,clip]{media/code.pdf}\n  \\captionof{lstlisting}[Example of constructing a vector of structs.]{Example of constructing a vector of structs.\n  Without considering arguments of MPI functions, we cannot deduce that \n  \\begin{enumi}\n  \\item a vector of structures is constructed, \n  \\item only the vector type is committed; hence, the struct is never used directly for MPI (communication) calls and\n  \\item the send operation makes use of the vector datatype.\n  \\end{enumi}\n}\\label{lst:mpi:derived}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nWe believe that there are several reasons why knowledge of how users interact on this granularity with MPI functions is beneficial:\n\\begin{enumerate} %[leftmargin=*]\n  \\item \\emph{Optimizations}: Library developers and tool developers can optimize based on common argument usage patterns~\\cite{gropp2011performance,jammer2022persistent}.\n  \\item \\emph{Correctness Tools}: Tool developers can identify interaction patterns that may be error-prone and need to be supported, such as the nesting of datatypes.\n  \\item \\emph{Correctness Benchmarks}: These codes must represent real-world usage, including erroneous argument usage patterns.\n  \\item \\emph{Education}: Understanding how developers use MPI is beneficial for teaching strategies to reflect common process interactions and discuss potential error-prone usage patterns.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nIn summary, we make the following contributions.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item We analyze the MPI usage in the codes used by Laguna et al., considering the newly available MPI~4.0 release.\nWe concentrate on three key insights, \n\\begin{enuma}\n\\item overall usage of MPI feature,\n\\item minimum required MPI version and \n\\item which, if any, hybrid model (MPI+X) is used. \n\\end{enuma}\n\n\\item We analyze how users interact with the MPI library at the granularity of function call arguments. \n\\item We provide our tool chain and our pre-computed MPI function call and argument classification database for other researchers to use, available at \\mpiusageURL\nTL:DR"
